The purge movies are deep, it shows the dark side of humanity and how those will act if a law was passed. I can't image how many people would actually do this if the purge was made real which I highly doubt...you got a lot of crazy people out there, they may look normal and act normal but deep down they have something inside of them that wants out.

The purge movies are deep, it shows the dark side of humanity and how those will act if a law was passed. I can't image how many people would actually do this if the purge was made real which I highly doubt...you got a lot of crazy people out there, they may look normal and act normal but deep down they have something inside of them that wants out.
