I hate trailers that spoil the entire story.

Nobody said he was a good person. 

yeah its kind of like dexter, the executives were worried people wouldnt like the movie as much if their wasn't any relation to kuklinkski

Just watched the Blu-Ray and I loved it. I didn't get a chance to see it in cinemas buts it's defiantly in my top 5 of the year so far

Michael Ironside IS Kuklinski 

You could also say that  he doesn't deserve a book about him either then?

It's a story. People like stories, if you don't like the story being told, don't watch or read it. 

Like butter

Can anyone tell me what is the name of music in the start of movie?
Great movie by the way!

great movie !!

Had computers since I was 5 and I'm 15 today, so lol nope. Dunno if you can type anything considering your english is just as horrible like a african with aids.

it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be but I still enjoyed the movie it's definitely worth a watch Shannon is damn good too

being famous and a star are two different things. If you become a serial killer odds are you won't be around to watch a movie about you... you'll be dead or in jail most likely

lol u trolled urself kid 

i have been using torrents for years, never had one virus

i guess u are just new to computers 

you mean parrot bay?


very good movie

Pirate Bay in other tab?

I took me awhile to recognize Christ, Omg :D 

This movie was good

hmmm.. they can't show every fucking thing the movies man.. But yeah you are right anyway ;) This is the first time I have heard about child hanging out of her wife... So sad that children gets abused, he got abused by his family and he passed his abusing to his and so on.. This fucking world will never heal.. But great movie anyway.. By the way you should learn that movies is never as the truth! they want to earn money and make it a little better than the orginal like always.. failing or not..

We know, but remember, its a movie...

There are many statements from his family..one simple google search that took a few seconds brings up an interview with barbara kuklinski from 2008 in the scotsman entitled 'The hitman and her: Barbara Kuklinski' 

Baby hanging out of her? What are you on crack?

There's no statement from him or his family saying that he beat his pregnant wife. He beat her, yes, but not to the point that his unborn child was hanging from his wife's vagina. That's absurd for you to say that's the "real" story.

Hitler murdered millions yet there's a movie about him every 2 years. You do not decide who about a movie is made.

and thats how murders become stars..if i will kill 200 ppl i believe they will make a movie about me as well..should i consider?

There's two full length documentaries where he admits all of his crimes. He was not a nice man, and he says as much. That being said, I still want to see this movie. I'll just keep in mind that it's a heavy fictionalized version of the true events.

If you do a bit of research on the net instead of talking smack on youtube you would know that he actually killed 2 of his unborn children from beatings he gave his wife. His own wife has stated that this was the case and it is also backed up with medical records at the time.


You say read the book to get the "Real" story and that the move is a load of crap.. How do you know that the book is the real story, were you there? the truth of film and books of this kind is that you will never know the full truth.. There is always oversights, lies and embellishment on all parts.. So don't act like you know the truth please, the only people who do are Kuklinski and his family.. Everyone will have their own opinion and that's it..

just finished watching this movie. Fucking phenomenal! I know Kuklinski was the definition of evil, but I loved how the movie shows that even he has a human side. I know a lot of people find this movie controversial as hell & Kuklinski didn't deserve a movie about him, but I still loved it.
Michael Shannon is excellent

Is this movie out

he is not considered a psychopath 

Agreed! This movie looks insanely screwed up. Glorifying killers...it's horrible and I have no respect for it.

Okay, so he's wrong. Not ALL torrent downloads give you viruses. Songs, movies, pictures and archives can't really give you viruses. But you better bet your ass that executable files for programs and video games (and the cracks, more often) sure can, and it's common enough and pretty well-known by now I'd figure. So before you flip a lid, realize that while he wasn't totally right, he sort of was.

Michael Shannon killed it as kulkinski!!!

General Zod!!

nothing like the book/docu sorry it sucked

Could have made a movie rooting for his wife? Anyway, the movie is made and by all the reviews it will flop.

Yeah and that probably is the "movie side" of things. It's tough to have a story when there's nobody to root for.

Very true but if you watch this trailer they are very much trying to portray him for something he wasn't, like some kind of victim standing up for the family he loved and that is utter nonsense...THAT is what I was commenting on.


It's not about whether he deserved a movie made about him or not. The messed up truth is that ppl are interested in these monsters. People like Ed Gein, Jeffery Domer, Adolf Hitler.

can give a link or something ?

one of the best movies of 2013

get anitvirus software then you fucking idiot torrents dont give you viruses unless your a fucking retard as you no doubt are they have systems in place for people to vote down a torrent kind of like your dumb ass comment

not very accurate to the real story they should have done it more like how it happend it would have come out better

what a load of crap! Read the book by Anthony Bruno called The Iceman to get the real story behind Kuklinski. He was an evil psychopath who murder on a whim and terrorised his family. He once beat his pregnant wife so hard the unborn child was hanging out of her and consequently died.
A man like that does not deserve a movie made of him!!

Zod?

I've been torrenting my whole damn life and never got infected even once.

Not gonna flame you like most other people on the net will, but just letting you know that if you know a bit about computers you can 100% of the time protect yourself from viruses.
Thing is many people don't know how to use computers and click on stupid ads (e.g. you are 999th visitor you won 1 million USD) or complete stupid surveys, download FAKE torrents etc.
If you know your way around, you'll be fine.
Same in real life - careful who you trust or you'll get stabbed in the back.

I thought they did a great job of showing the unresolvable contradiction: how the fuck can this doting family man, be a mass murderer. He showed a different side to his family, that's for sure. Shannon is probably the best actor working right now, he is better than veterans. Just when you thought he was all about nerd freakouts, he nails this part which involves a blue collar, ancient like... fucking werewolf. Anyway, I'd like to see anyone in the world disrespect Shannon. He always kills it.

i was kinda disappointed by this movie. they tried to show the iceman from a more human side which in my opinion totally neglected his montrous side. if you watch the iceman interviews with the real guy it becomes clear that he is such a dark person and i know he must have seemed softer to his family and friends but in my opinion the movie didn't really put a lot of effort into showing that psychopatchic side.

in my opinion, yes, it is worth buying. it was really good!

This movie was great! I always loved crime dramas. It was a really good gangster flick.

Is this a good movie? Is it worth the buy?

like 100 movies over the past 3 years have been downloaded and no problems on macbook or pc.

"piracy is a crime"

gay

piracy is a crime


I knew the Mr Softee guy i made fun of his son and he threw a milkshake all over me, i was 13. He was a coward.

Yeah, I hate myself, I'm disgusted by myself. I detest myself and not to mention that I'm corrupted in my brain.. :(

I downloaded thousands of torrents, 0 viruses so far. 

"don't go full retard" 

The most mainstream comment youtube or any global website ever seen.

Yeah, I know, I'm complete retard.

Already did, sorry bro.

This looks interesting. Winona Ryder is in so I might check it out. Michael Shannon is untouchable, ok?

dont go full retard

goooooooooood movie


one of the best movies i have watched this year, if not the best..

Very poorly written and more importantly directed movie considering the vast amount of material these guys had to work from.

ZOOOOOOD! KRYPTON

that means its "impossible" to receive viruses over torrents if you have a brain superior to that of a goldfish. i wish you good luck in the ocean, watch out for the bigger fish

Exactly.

only if you are a retard who doesnt read comments and picks torrents with 1 seeder

You've been inside your room for too long, I must advice you to step out and experience real life for a change.

No, I am saying that it is "possible" to receive viruses over torrents.

Beautiful film.
Thanks YIFY & PB <3

This movie is really really good, Iceman was a crazy mothafucka, didn't think twice about killin someone

You have nothing to worry about when downloading torrents.SMH i dont know what you are trying to do here.I have been downloading since 6 years,Its limewire that gives viruses and fucksup your computer.Im guessing you are the dumbfuck that used it?

Dont troll a troll.You fucking dick blower,Go waste your time on 9gag.

Torrents can give you viruses, you must be new to the internet :)

Verry guud

I am not mad!!!! no no no no!!! You are mad for saying torrents give you virus hahahahahhaha fucking terrorist

Plain and simple just like that

Oh!!! you blow your father with that mouth??The language on this fuck!! huhh

Youre an idiot!Now you are also quite like a church mouse.Hehehehe go back and turn parental control on heheheeheheh and enjoy netflix.How much was it 15 dollars..uhh and ill download samething for free.While you say ill get virus.Just like religious people say to atheists youll go to hell..hehehheheheheheh bye loser.hehehehehe

I hate itunes and I hate netflix the people who use them don't know anything about the internet or technology. They're people who act like they do but pay a lot of money to have a company do it for them.

WATCH it its a good movie

No they dont!!torrents are completely safe you fairy!

Torrents dont give you viruses.Being a dumb fuck can.No torrent ive ever downloaded has given me a malware or virus.You are a stupid guy who thinks everyone pays for online services.

You are the biggest,umm no not the biggest idiot but yeah in the top league of the biggest idiots ive met online.Saying torrents give you virus is like saying drinking too much water can mess up with your kidneys.You fucking cocksucker every single motherfucker on here on this page would shit down your throat for your stupid comment about torrents.Wait tommorow and see them thumbs go boom.

No they don't <.<, learn to download from the right pages instead of some shitty site. YOU should get your shit straight.

Dunno if you're retarded or just trolling.

But Netflix cost about 10-15 US dollars per month.
And yes, torrents give you viruses. Please get your shit straight man.

And what Tv shows have you been watching my fucktard dear?fucking loser

you rich happy go lucky ignorant ass urban cock sucker!!not many people use itunes or netflix.And who the fuck told you torrents can give virus.HAHAHAHHAAHAHAHHHAHA Who the fuck told you that??Kill him hhahahahahhahhaah cant stop laughing...

I hate trailers that spoil the entire story.

Nobody said he was a good person. 

yeah its kind of like dexter, the executives were worried people wouldnt like the movie as much if their wasn't any relation to kuklinkski

Just watched the Blu-Ray and I loved it. I didn't get a chance to see it in cinemas buts it's defiantly in my top 5 of the year so far

what a load of crap! Read the book by Anthony Bruno called The Iceman to get the real story behind Kuklinski. He was an evil psychopath who murder on a whim and terrorised his family. He once beat his pregnant wife so hard the unborn child was hanging out of her and consequently died.
A man like that does not deserve a movie made of him!!

Zod?

I've been torrenting my whole damn life and never got infected even once.

Not gonna flame you like most other people on the net will, but just letting you know that if you know a bit about computers you can 100% of the time protect yourself from viruses.
Thing is many people don't know how to use computers and click on stupid ads (e.g. you are 999th visitor you won 1 million USD) or complete stupid surveys, download FAKE torrents etc.
If you know your way around, you'll be fine.
Same in real life - careful who you trust or you'll get stabbed in the back.

I thought they did a great job of showing the unresolvable contradiction: how the fuck can this doting family man, be a mass murderer. He showed a different side to his family, that's for sure. Shannon is probably the best actor working right now, he is better than veterans. Just when you thought he was all about nerd freakouts, he nails this part which involves a blue collar, ancient like... fucking werewolf. Anyway, I'd like to see anyone in the world disrespect Shannon. He always kills it.

i was kinda disappointed by this movie. they tried to show the iceman from a more human side which in my opinion totally neglected his montrous side. if you watch the iceman interviews with the real guy it becomes clear that he is such a dark person and i know he must have seemed softer to his family and friends but in my opinion the movie didn't really put a lot of effort into showing that psychopatchic side.

in my opinion, yes, it is worth buying. it was really good!

I hate trailers that spoil the entire story.

Nobody said he was a good person. 

yeah its kind of like dexter, the executives were worried people wouldnt like the movie as much if their wasn't any relation to kuklinkski

Just watched the Blu-Ray and I loved it. I didn't get a chance to see it in cinemas buts it's defiantly in my top 5 of the year so far

Michael Ironside IS Kuklinski 

You could also say that  he doesn't deserve a book about him either then?

It's a story. People like stories, if you don't like the story being told, don't watch or read it. 

Like butter

Can anyone tell me what is the name of music in the start of movie?
Great movie by the way!

great movie !!

Had computers since I was 5 and I'm 15 today, so lol nope. Dunno if you can type anything considering your english is just as horrible like a african with aids.

it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be but I still enjoyed the movie it's definitely worth a watch Shannon is damn good too

being famous and a star are two different things. If you become a serial killer odds are you won't be around to watch a movie about you... you'll be dead or in jail most likely

lol u trolled urself kid 

i have been using torrents for years, never had one virus

i guess u are just new to computers 

you mean parrot bay?


very good movie

Pirate Bay in other tab?

I took me awhile to recognize Christ, Omg :D 

This movie was good

hmmm.. they can't show every fucking thing the movies man.. But yeah you are right anyway ;) This is the first time I have heard about child hanging out of her wife... So sad that children gets abused, he got abused by his family and he passed his abusing to his and so on.. This fucking world will never heal.. But great movie anyway.. By the way you should learn that movies is never as the truth! they want to earn money and make it a little better than the orginal like always.. failing or not..

We know, but remember, its a movie...

There are many statements from his family..one simple google search that took a few seconds brings up an interview with barbara kuklinski from 2008 in the scotsman entitled 'The hitman and her: Barbara Kuklinski' 

Baby hanging out of her? What are you on crack?

There's no statement from him or his family saying that he beat his pregnant wife. He beat her, yes, but not to the point that his unborn child was hanging from his wife's vagina. That's absurd for you to say that's the "real" story.

Hitler murdered millions yet there's a movie about him every 2 years. You do not decide who about a movie is made.

and thats how murders become stars..if i will kill 200 ppl i believe they will make a movie about me as well..should i consider?

There's two full length documentaries where he admits all of his crimes. He was not a nice man, and he says as much. That being said, I still want to see this movie. I'll just keep in mind that it's a heavy fictionalized version of the true events.

If you do a bit of research on the net instead of talking smack on youtube you would know that he actually killed 2 of his unborn children from beatings he gave his wife. His own wife has stated that this was the case and it is also backed up with medical records at the time.


You say read the book to get the "Real" story and that the move is a load of crap.. How do you know that the book is the real story, were you there? the truth of film and books of this kind is that you will never know the full truth.. There is always oversights, lies and embellishment on all parts.. So don't act like you know the truth please, the only people who do are Kuklinski and his family.. Everyone will have their own opinion and that's it..

just finished watching this movie. Fucking phenomenal! I know Kuklinski was the definition of evil, but I loved how the movie shows that even he has a human side. I know a lot of people find this movie controversial as hell & Kuklinski didn't deserve a movie about him, but I still loved it.
Michael Shannon is excellent

Is this movie out

he is not considered a psychopath 

Agreed! This movie looks insanely screwed up. Glorifying killers...it's horrible and I have no respect for it.

Okay, so he's wrong. Not ALL torrent downloads give you viruses. Songs, movies, pictures and archives can't really give you viruses. But you better bet your ass that executable files for programs and video games (and the cracks, more often) sure can, and it's common enough and pretty well-known by now I'd figure. So before you flip a lid, realize that while he wasn't totally right, he sort of was.

Michael Shannon killed it as kulkinski!!!

General Zod!!

nothing like the book/docu sorry it sucked

Could have made a movie rooting for his wife? Anyway, the movie is made and by all the reviews it will flop.

Yeah and that probably is the "movie side" of things. It's tough to have a story when there's nobody to root for.

Very true but if you watch this trailer they are very much trying to portray him for something he wasn't, like some kind of victim standing up for the family he loved and that is utter nonsense...THAT is what I was commenting on.


It's not about whether he deserved a movie made about him or not. The messed up truth is that ppl are interested in these monsters. People like Ed Gein, Jeffery Domer, Adolf Hitler. We think to ourselves, "How could somebody do such a thing?" and then we watch movies about them and read about them in hopes of better understanding their deranged minds. What exactly creates a monster how do these ppl see the world? Their perception is obviously very different from that of a normal person.

just watched the movie and it wasn't NEARLY as interesting as the real story.  Good acting, terrible story telling.

I thought they did a great job of showing the unresolvable contradiction: how the fuck can this doting family man, be a mass murderer. He showed a different side to his family, that's for sure. Shannon is probably the best actor working right now, he is better than veterans. Just when you thought he was all about nerd freakouts, he nails this part which involves a blue collar, ancient like... fucking werewolf. Anyway, I'd like to see anyone in the world disrespect Shannon. He always kills it.

i was kinda disappointed by this movie. they tried to show the iceman from a more human side which in my opinion totally neglected his montrous side. if you watch the iceman interviews with the real guy it becomes clear that he is such a dark person and i know he must have seemed softer to his family and friends but in my opinion the movie didn't really put a lot of effort into showing that psychopatchic side.

They better make this good cause RIchard was a pathalogical liar and a constant wife beater. This movie makes him such a family man and not the cold blooded killer he is in real life. 

crazy good movie!

Deffo recommend- on par with films such as Goodfellas and the departed

I hope there is a scene in this movie where Michael Shannon freaks out and tells everyone off like in his other movies, he is so awesome at that

 I Will FIND HIM!

You and 49 other idiots.. Join Miley Cirus.

Its Greg boule guys!

Omg Why not leave the name of the movie for the SUper hero... Jesus!!!

Anyone else is here because they have seen ZOD in MAN OF STEEL? Well, I am:)

no me ha gustado el protagonista que interpreta a RICHARD KUKLINSKI tiene sentimientos hacia los que mata y el kuklinski real ha dicho siempre que el nunca sintio nada hacia las personas que asesinaba

Hentai, oh really?

Enjoy your viruses 

There is a interview with the real ice man on youtube, He is fucked up 

yify bought use here

The film was okay. The lead played Richard fine. However, the film seem to paint him in an anti-hero type of light, when he was a cold blooded murderer who enjoyed killing. One of the most cruel murders they left out, was when he killed an innocent man waiting for a bus with his new crossbow, just to see if it worked. And it didn't show how he would savagely beat his wife and daughters. If film also didn't show how he would set a lot of guys up with fake deals, then killed and robbed them. 

Yah, they did miss a lot.  Still not sure how they could have fit it all in.  Even if half of what Kuklinski said was true, this would have had to be a 4 hour film just to get half of that in.  

Still, the director seemed to water it down, but Shannon carried this film superbly.  If the story were stronger, this would have been an epic movie.

Shannon carried this film with true force.  He seems to have that air of intensity that the book generates around Kuklinski, and his eyes alone speak much of the best dialogue.  You dont see many actors who can do that.  The story could have been better done, but it would have been extraordinarily tough given it covers 20 years.

The actor made this film, and does it well enough for me to still be pretty damned good.  Many people expected a ficton mob thriller.  This was a true story adaptation.

Based on a true story, not a documentary.  You dumb illiterate fucks.

is this a talk talk movie or action?

Noobs, I use xbmc with icefilms :D

Michael Shannon is amazing. He has this unique magnetism like R. de Niro. You just want to watch him as he acts. I hope Micheal will involve himself in even more requiring roles. His potential is outstanding!

Wonderful movie! <3

They never showed kuklinskis sick sense of humour in the film, not even once :( its still pretty good tho

GO HOME ZOD YOU ARE DRUNK

the movie was a disipointment miss out loads of key points and murders. 
1.the murder of the shot gun what blows his the mans face off at the red lights.
2.the one where the men tryed to run him off the road and he got out his car and killed all 4 of the men.
3.where they had the bet when he shot the man in the adams apple. 

sorry for bad grammar :) 

You.. are completely correct!
I too wanted to see this film, but what the fuck?
Seriously garbage film made with money in sight only. The re-made the true story to fit how a film should be. Not how reality was.

If you really need to see this film then I encourage everyone to just download this film and spread it illegal so moviecreator do not get money.
Watch "Confessions of a mafia hitman" instead. Its THE only way to see Kuklinski. 

Thumbs up for Silverhourse comment

Your statement is so wrong. Its not a great film, its shit. Utter fking shit. Moviecreator is bending the truth in this film. But no matter what, you are truly wrong. He beat his wife several times. According to himself, he felt most happiness when beeing home with his family, but it didnt stop him from beeing him. A monster who did not care when it came to cruelty.

His family broke all contact. Says it all. So read up better on the story cause ur wrong. "Confessions of a mafia hitman" (1992).

Youtube searchfield; "Confessions of a mafia hitman"
Better to have it without it taking up any space.

Do not watch this film legit, download it! Dont give maker any money for bending the truth when he could have made the true story.

Why is he suddenly a loving father and husband in this film? In "Confessions of a mafia hitman" you see his wife and its pretty hard to miss how her nose has been broken several times. 

The mafia may have gotten interest in Kuklinski, but they had absolutly nothing to do with his first murder or how he turned bad.  Watch 'Confessions of a mafia hitman' instead!

Scenetime reporting in

haha me too xD 

Any luck ? 

He may have had three kids? but how are you gunner know that he dint flip out on his wife? he isn't gunner tell every single detail off his life is he.

kickass is kickass

I have watched every documentary and read every book about Richard Kuklinski. I have to say I was real excited about this movie when it came out. But....They completely dropped the ball on this one. There were a few parts that were true to the books and documentaries. But the rest was just not there it lacked the kuklinski flare. I think they should get another big name movie company and redo this one from the ground up. Use the books use the documentaries and redo the film.

Zod kills captain america in this! lol great movie

never mind the movie is already out on youtube lol

Saw the whole documentary, cant wait to see how they pull this off!!

So you are THAT guy.


Not really

somone say what is that song called in movie,when they killed that guy in club with spray.


General Zod + Captain America = The Iceman

Nowhere close to being as good as the book!

Still made a pretty fucking good movie.

the movie missed out his whole childhood from the book.

Mine is Viooz <3

This was surprisingly a really good movie! some things embellished but over all, a great job!

THIS IS A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT!!! YOU COULD WATCH THIS MOVIE FREE WITHOUT DOWNLOAD ON VIOOZ.COM

I WILL FIND HIM !!!

great film, but he had three kids, not even two and he never flipped out on his wife and busted up their kitchen

His voice is the same? He,s a stone cold killer!

good movie! wished they showed more though, like when he was young instead of jumping right onto the middle of the plot. But still a good movie.

swj ch?op !!

mine also hahaha


anyone know where to get we're the millers or wat


Michael Shannon is an outstanding actor 

I tohught It was gonna be an ICEMAN, like Yeti or sometihng.....I have such childish exceptations

Good job, im sure he raised you better! Were you raised or thrown up?

hahaha true


after seen the documentary first i have to say it was more intense than the slightly rushed and cramped film. 

Hahah you know me too well!

Actually kickass torrents its waay better!

just saw movie, fucking badass

Clown

you stupid idiot you know absolutely nothing try watching a fucking interview with his wife. eat shit, richard kuklinsky is a hero

kneel before zod!

Saw this just right now, I must say it's a very good movie. Would of enjoyed it more if it was longer and showed more out of his life from when he was a little kid. But good movie :D

He nearly killed his wife by stabbing her in the back.  He also caused her to have miscarriages and his children lived in constant fear of him.  Yeah, he was a stone cold psychopath.  He sometimes murdered on impulse and not for money.  He insisted in interviews, though, that he never killed women and children and thought of himself as a good family man.The movie may not be glorifying him, but depicting his self-delusions.

U sure got a shitty grammar 

hahaha rofl, clearly you dont understand acting hahahah 

   rarbg.com/torrent/gmf6v32

Wow it wasn't like this AT ALL. Not even gonna pirate it.

*sole purpose

"Look at this. We could have rebuilt Krypton on this planet, but you chose the humans over us. I exist only to protect Krypton. That is the soul purpose for which I was born. And every action I take, no matter how violent or how cruel, is for the greater good of my people. And now, I have no people. My soul, that is what you have taken from me!"

stfu dad

do i get a free virus to ?

A bit of an unnecessary Foul mouthed reaction don't you think? And by the way, using language like that just shows that you're of inferior Intelligence. 


stfu faggot.......we wont have tbp because of kooks like you......noob cunt

Watch this /watch?v=QBS4iKvBj6c the interview of the real iceman an evil bastard who clearly didn't care and felt nothing when he killed. But they do clear up why hes like it 9/10 its always the genes and the way you are brought up 

even sounds like him, a scary man!

You Know what...some of yous wouldn't know talent if it slapped you in you f..in face. Just seen the movie. Didn't like Michael Shannon till I watched this. He adapted perfectly for this role. And let's face it...he could easily play a psyco's role. He has that kinda face. This movie just lacked the right marketing and the screenplay could've been rearranged a lil better. Just seemed like they could've expanded more on his killing sprees..I mean... the guy was active from '48 - '86. 

Just saw this movie, holy fucking shit Michael Shannon is an AMAZING actor.

keep trolling bro :) 

U sure got a shitty taste

How could they fuck up such a film? SHITTY casting ,mediocre script, winona sucks ass , Michael Shannon is mediocre and not up to the task, Mr Softee is a strong character yet downplayed in the script and the actor is mediocre. A shitty job all around- was really sadened cause that psychopath's story could have been an oscar movie if it was done right. The documentary outperfoms the movie

piratebay sons

go for it


fuck no micheal shannon is one of the worst actors that ever lived lmao 

Great movie, one of my favorites.

seems awesome, i must watch xD

damn near oscar like performance as a damn comic book villain, that says it all.

real ice cold badass.

yify,

no


He did. He was a sociopath and killed when he needed to. We do glorify these guys because ultimately Kuklinski was a serial killer who happened to find the right work at the right time. He practiced and perfect the art of the kill and was a real hitman. A byproduct of Gangland and all its excesses.  

It's that crazy German doctor!

Take a hike!

this movie was crap I expected to see more killings. Read the book its way better

"I dont kill women or children" and that's how America glorifies killers, puts them in the limelight, and expect us to go "WOW HE'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD GUY! KILLING THOSE BAD DUDES AND STUFF" by somehow making one human life more important than the next through the brainwashing of children and women being more important than men. Oh I forgot, because we're in front lines in war our lives are more expendable. Gotta love it. Chances are he probably did kill his share of women.

I hate trailers that spoil the entire story.

Nobody said he was a good person. 

yeah its kind of like dexter, the executives were worried people wouldnt like the movie as much if their wasn't any relation to kuklinkski

Just watched the Blu-Ray and I loved it. I didn't get a chance to see it in cinemas buts it's defiantly in my top 5 of the year so far

Michael Ironside IS Kuklinski 

You could also say that  he doesn't deserve a book about him either then?

It's a story. People like stories, if you don't like the story being told, don't watch or read it. 

Like butter

Can anyone tell me what is the name of music in the start of movie?
Great movie by the way!

great movie !!

Had computers since I was 5 and I'm 15 today, so lol nope. Dunno if you can type anything considering your english is just as horrible like a african with aids.

it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be but I still enjoyed the movie it's definitely worth a watch Shannon is damn good too

being famous and a star are two different things. If you become a serial killer odds are you won't be around to watch a movie about you... you'll be dead or in jail most likely

lol u trolled urself kid 

i have been using torrents for years, never had one virus

i guess u are just new to computers 

you mean parrot bay?


very good movie

Pirate Bay in other tab?

I took me awhile to recognize Christ, Omg :D 

This movie was good

hmmm.. they can't show every fucking thing the movies man.. But yeah you are right anyway ;) This is the first time I have heard about child hanging out of her wife... So sad that children gets abused, he got abused by his family and he passed his abusing to his and so on.. This fucking world will never heal.. But great movie anyway.. By the way you should learn that movies is never as the truth! they want to earn money and make it a little better than the orginal like always.. failing or not..

We know, but remember, its a movie...

There are many statements from his family..one simple google search that took a few seconds brings up an interview with barbara kuklinski from 2008 in the scotsman entitled 'The hitman and her: Barbara Kuklinski' 

Baby hanging out of her? What are you on crack?

There's no statement from him or his family saying that he beat his pregnant wife. He beat her, yes, but not to the point that his unborn child was hanging from his wife's vagina. That's absurd for you to say that's the "real" story.

Hitler murdered millions yet there's a movie about him every 2 years. You do not decide who about a movie is made.

and thats how murders become stars..if i will kill 200 ppl i believe they will make a movie about me as well..should i consider?

There's two full length documentaries where he admits all of his crimes. He was not a nice man, and he says as much. That being said, I still want to see this movie. I'll just keep in mind that it's a heavy fictionalized version of the true events.

If you do a bit of research on the net instead of talking smack on youtube you would know that he actually killed 2 of his unborn children from beatings he gave his wife. His own wife has stated that this was the case and it is also backed up with medical records at the time.


You say read the book to get the "Real" story and that the move is a load of crap.. How do you know that the book is the real story, were you there? the truth of film and books of this kind is that you will never know the full truth.. There is always oversights, lies and embellishment on all parts.. So don't act like you know the truth please, the only people who do are Kuklinski and his family.. Everyone will have their own opinion and that's it..

just finished watching this movie. Fucking phenomenal! I know Kuklinski was the definition of evil, but I loved how the movie shows that even he has a human side. I know a lot of people find this movie controversial as hell & Kuklinski didn't deserve a movie about him, but I still loved it.
Michael Shannon is excellent

Is this movie out

he is not considered a psychopath 

Agreed! This movie looks insanely screwed up. Glorifying killers...it's horrible and I have no respect for it.

Okay, so he's wrong. Not ALL torrent downloads give you viruses. Songs, movies, pictures and archives can't really give you viruses. But you better bet your ass that executable files for programs and video games (and the cracks, more often) sure can, and it's common enough and pretty well-known by now I'd figure. So before you flip a lid, realize that while he wasn't totally right, he sort of was.

Michael Shannon killed it as kulkinski!!!

General Zod!!

nothing like the book/docu sorry it sucked

Could have made a movie rooting for his wife? Anyway, the movie is made and by all the reviews it will flop.

Yeah and that probably is the "movie side" of things. It's tough to have a story when there's nobody to root for.

Very true but if you watch this trailer they are very much trying to portray him for something he wasn't, like some kind of victim standing up for the family he loved and that is utter nonsense...THAT is what I was commenting on.


It's not about whether he deserved a movie made about him or not. The messed up truth is that ppl are interested in these monsters. People like Ed Gein, Jeffery Domer, Adolf Hitler. We think to ourselves, "How could somebody do such a thing?" and then we watch movies about them and read about them in hopes of better understanding their deranged minds. What exactly creates a monster how do these ppl see the world? Their perception is obviously very different from that of a normal person.

just watched the movie and it wasn't NEARLY as interesting as the real story.  Good acting, terrible story telling.

retard

i watched the documentary and red some articels , there was never something like that stated. 
can give a link or something ?

one of the best movies of 2013

get anitvirus software then you fucking idiot torrents dont give you viruses unless your a fucking retard as you no doubt are they have systems in place for people to vote down a torrent kind of like your dumb ass comment

not very accurate to the real story they should have done it more like how it happend it would have come out better

what a load of crap! Read the book by Anthony Bruno called The Iceman to get the real story behind Kuklinski. He was an evil psychopath who murder on a whim and terrorised his family. He once beat his pregnant wife so hard the unborn child was hanging out of her and consequently died.
A man like that does not deserve a movie made of him!!

Zod?

I've been torrenting my whole damn life and never got infected even once.

Not gonna flame you like most other people on the net will, but just letting you know that if you know a bit about computers you can 100% of the time protect yourself from viruses.
Thing is many people don't know how to use computers and click on stupid ads (e.g. you are 999th visitor you won 1 million USD) or complete stupid surveys, download FAKE torrents etc.
If you know your way around, you'll be fine.
Same in real life - careful who you trust or you'll get stabbed in the back.

I thought they did a great job of showing the unresolvable contradiction: how the fuck can this doting family man, be a mass murderer. He showed a different side to his family, that's for sure. Shannon is probably the best actor working right now, he is better than veterans. Just when you thought he was all about nerd freakouts, he nails this part which involves a blue collar, ancient like... fucking werewolf. Anyway, I'd like to see anyone in the world disrespect Shannon. He always kills it.

i was kinda disappointed by this movie. they tried to show the iceman from a more human side which in my opinion totally neglected his montrous side. if you watch the iceman interviews with the real guy it becomes clear that he is such a dark person and i know he must have seemed softer to his family and friends but in my opinion the movie didn't really put a lot of effort into showing that psychopatchic side.

in my opinion, yes, it is worth buying. it was really good!

This movie was great! I always loved crime dramas. It was a really good gangster flick.

Is this a good movie? Is it worth the buy?

like 100 movies over the past 3 years have been downloaded and no problems on macbook or pc.

"piracy is a crime"

gay

piracy is a crime


I knew the Mr Softee guy i made fun of his son and he threw a milkshake all over me, i was 13. He was a coward.

Yeah, I hate myself, I'm disgusted by myself. I detest myself and not to mention that I'm corrupted in my brain.. :(

I downloaded thousands of torrents, 0 viruses so far. 

"don't go full retard" 

The most mainstream comment youtube or any global website ever seen.

Yeah, I know, I'm complete retard.

Already did, sorry bro.

This looks interesting. Winona Ryder is in so I might check it out. Michael Shannon is untouchable, ok?

dont go full retard

goooooooooood movie


one of the best movies i have watched this year, if not the best..

Very poorly written and more importantly directed movie considering the vast amount of material these guys had to work from.

ZOOOOOOD! KRYPTON

that means its "impossible" to receive viruses over torrents if you have a brain superior to that of a goldfish. i wish you good luck in the ocean, watch out for the bigger fish

Exactly.

only if you are a retard who doesnt read comments and picks torrents with 1 seeder

You've been inside your room for too long, I must advice you to step out and experience real life for a change.

No, I am saying that it is "possible" to receive viruses over torrents.

Beautiful film.
Thanks YIFY & PB <3

This movie is really really good, Iceman was a crazy mothafucka, didn't think twice about killin someone

You have nothing to worry about when downloading torrents.SMH i dont know what you are trying to do here.I have been downloading since 6 years,Its limewire that gives viruses and fucksup your computer.Im guessing you are the dumbfuck that used it?

No they dont!!torrents are completely safe you fairy!

Torrents dont give you viruses.Being a dumb fuck can.No torrent ive ever downloaded has given me a malware or virus.You are a stupid guy who thinks everyone pays for online services.

You are the biggest,umm no not the biggest idiot but yeah in the top league of the biggest idiots ive met online.Saying torrents give you virus is like saying drinking too much water can mess up with your kidneys.You fucking cocksucker every single motherfucker on here on this page would shit down your throat for your stupid comment about torrents.Wait tommorow and see them thumbs go boom.

No they don't <.<, learn to download from the right pages instead of some shitty site. YOU should get your shit straight.

Dunno if you're retarded or just trolling.

i was kinda disappointed by this movie. they tried to show the iceman from a more human side which in my opinion totally neglected his montrous side. if you watch the iceman interviews with the real guy it becomes clear that he is such a dark person and i know he must have seemed softer to his family and friends but in my opinion the movie didn't really put a lot of effort into showing that psychopatchic side.

in my opinion, yes, it is worth buying. it was really good!

This movie was great! I always loved crime dramas. It was a really good gangster flick.

Is this a good movie? Is it worth the buy?

like 100 movies over the past 3 years have been downloaded and no problems on macbook or pc.

"piracy is a crime"

gay

piracy is a crime


I knew the Mr Softee guy i made fun of his son and he threw a milkshake all over me, i was 13. He was a coward.

Yeah, I hate myself, I'm disgusted by myself. I detest myself and not to mention that I'm corrupted in my brain.. :(

I downloaded thousands of torrents, 0 viruses so far. 

"don't go full retard" 

The most mainstream comment youtube or any global website ever seen.

Yeah, I know, I'm complete retard.

Already did, sorry bro.

This looks interesting. Winona Ryder is in so I might check it out. Michael Shannon is untouchable, ok?

dont go full retard

goooooooooood movie


one of the best movies i have watched this year, if not the best..

Very poorly written and more importantly directed movie considering the vast amount of material these guys had to work from.

ZOOOOOOD! KRYPTON

that means its "impossible" to receive viruses over torrents if you have a brain superior to that of a goldfish. i wish you good luck in the ocean, watch out for the bigger fish

Exactly.

only if you are a retard who doesnt read comments and picks torrents with 1 seeder

You've been inside your room for too long, I must advice you to step out and experience real life for a change.

No, I am saying that it is "possible" to receive viruses over torrents.

Beautiful film.
Thanks YIFY & PB <3

This movie is really really good, Iceman was a crazy mothafucka, didn't think twice about killin someone

You have nothing to worry about when downloading torrents.SMH i dont know what you are trying to do here.I have been downloading since 6 years,Its limewire that gives viruses and fucksup your computer.Im guessing you are the dumbfuck that used it?

I hate itunes and I hate netflix the people who use them don't know anything about the internet or technology. They're people who act like they do but pay a lot of money to have a company do it for them.

WATCH it its a good movie

No they dont!!torrents are completely safe you fairy!

Torrents dont give you viruses.Being a dumb fuck can.No torrent ive ever downloaded has given me a malware or virus.You are a stupid guy who thinks everyone pays for online services.

You are the biggest,umm no not the biggest idiot but yeah in the top league of the biggest idiots ive met online.Saying torrents give you virus is like saying drinking too much water can mess up with your kidneys.You fucking cocksucker every single motherfucker on here on this page would shit down your throat for your stupid comment about torrents.Wait tommorow and see them thumbs go boom.

No they don't <.<, learn to download from the right pages instead of some shitty site. YOU should get your shit straight.

8 inches.....

They better make this good cause RIchard was a pathalogical liar and a constant wife beater. This movie makes him such a family man and not the cold blooded killer he is in real life. 

crazy good movie!

Deffo recommend- on par with films such as Goodfellas and the departed

I hope there is a scene in this movie where Michael Shannon freaks out and tells everyone off like in his other movies, he is so awesome at that

 I Will FIND HIM!

You and 49 other idiots.. Join Miley Cirus.

Its Greg boule guys!

Omg Why not leave the name of the movie for the SUper hero... Jesus!!!

Anyone else is here because they have seen ZOD in MAN OF STEEL? Well, I am:)

no me ha gustado el protagonista que interpreta a RICHARD KUKLINSKI tiene sentimientos hacia los que mata y el kuklinski real ha dicho siempre que el nunca sintio nada hacia las personas que asesinaba

Hentai, oh really?

Enjoy your viruses 

There is a interview with the real ice man on youtube, He is fucked up 

yify bought use here

The film was okay. The lead played Richard fine. However, the film seem to paint him in an anti-hero type of light, when he was a cold blooded murderer who enjoyed killing. One of the most cruel murders they left out, was when he killed an innocent man waiting for a bus with his new crossbow, just to see if it worked. And it didn't show how he would savagely beat his wife and daughters. If film also didn't show how he would set a lot of guys up with fake deals, then killed and robbed them. 

Yah, they did miss a lot.  Still not sure how they could have fit it all in.  Even if half of what Kuklinski said was true, this would have had to be a 4 hour film just to get half of that in.  

Still, the director seemed to water it down, but Shannon carried this film superbly.  If the story were stronger, this would have been an epic movie.

Shannon carried this film with true force.  He seems to have that air of intensity that the book generates around Kuklinski, and his eyes alone speak much of the best dialogue.  You dont see many actors who can do that.  The story could have been better done, but it would have been extraordinarily tough given it covers 20 years.

The actor made this film, and does it well enough for me to still be pretty damned good.  Many people expected a ficton mob thriller.  This was a true story adaptation.

Based on a true story, not a documentary.  You dumb illiterate fucks.

is this a talk talk movie or action?

Noobs, I use xbmc with icefilms :D

Michael Shannon is amazing. He has this unique magnetism like R. de Niro. You just want to watch him as he acts. I hope Micheal will involve himself in even more requiring roles. His potential is outstanding!

Wonderful movie! <3

They never showed kuklinskis sick sense of humour in the film, not even once :( its still pretty good tho

GO HOME ZOD YOU ARE DRUNK

the movie was a disipointment miss out loads of key points and murders. 
1.the murder of the shot gun what blows his the mans face off at the red lights.
2.the one where the men tryed to run him off the road and he got out his car and killed all 4 of the men.
3.where they had the bet when he shot the man in the adams apple. 

sorry for bad grammar :) 

You.. are completely correct!
I too wanted to see this film, but what the fuck?
Seriously garbage film made with money in sight only. The re-made the true story to fit how a film should be. Not how reality was.

If you really need to see this film then I encourage everyone to just download this film and spread it illegal so moviecreator do not get money.
Watch "Confessions of a mafia hitman" instead. Its THE only way to see Kuklinski. 

Thumbs up for Silverhourse comment

Your statement is so wrong. Its not a great film, its shit. Utter fking shit. Moviecreator is bending the truth in this film. But no matter what, you are truly wrong. He beat his wife several times. According to himself, he felt most happiness when beeing home with his family, but it didnt stop him from beeing him. A monster who did not care when it came to cruelty.

His family broke all contact. Says it all. So read up better on the story cause ur wrong. "Confessions of a mafia hitman" (1992).

Youtube searchfield; "Confessions of a mafia hitman"
Better to have it without it taking up any space.

Do not watch this film legit, download it! Dont give maker any money for bending the truth when he could have made the true story.

Why is he suddenly a loving father and husband in this film? In "Confessions of a mafia hitman" you see his wife and its pretty hard to miss how her nose has been broken several times. 

The mafia may have gotten interest in Kuklinski, but they had absolutly nothing to do with his first murder or how he turned bad.  Watch 'Confessions of a mafia hitman' instead!

Scenetime reporting in

haha me too xD 

Any luck ? 

He may have had three kids? but how are you gunner know that he dint flip out on his wife? he isn't gunner tell every single detail off his life is he.

kickass is kickass

I have watched every documentary and read every book about Richard Kuklinski. I have to say I was real excited about this movie when it came out. But....They completely dropped the ball on this one. There were a few parts that were true to the books and documentaries. But the rest was just not there it lacked the kuklinski flare. I think they should get another big name movie company and redo this one from the ground up. Use the books use the documentaries and redo the film.

Zod kills captain america in this! lol great movie

never mind the movie is already out on youtube lol

Saw the whole documentary, cant wait to see how they pull this off!!

So you are THAT guy.


Not really

somone say what is that song called in movie,when they killed that guy in club with spray.


General Zod + Captain America = The Iceman

Nowhere close to being as good as the book!

Still made a pretty fucking good movie.

the movie missed out his whole childhood from the book.

Mine is Viooz <3

This was surprisingly a really good movie! some things embellished but over all, a great job!

THIS IS A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT!!! YOU COULD WATCH THIS MOVIE FREE WITHOUT DOWNLOAD ON VIOOZ.COM

I WILL FIND HIM !!!

great film, but he had three kids, not even two and he never flipped out on his wife and busted up their kitchen

His voice is the same? He,s a stone cold killer!

good movie! wished they showed more though, like when he was young instead of jumping right onto the middle of the plot. But still a good movie.

swj ch?op !!

mine also hahaha


anyone know where to get we're the millers or wat


Michael Shannon is an outstanding actor 

I tohught It was gonna be an ICEMAN, like Yeti or sometihng.....I have such childish exceptations

Good job, im sure he raised you better! Were you raised or thrown up?

hahaha true


after seen the documentary first i have to say it was more intense than the slightly rushed and cramped film. 

Hahah you know me too well!

Actually kickass torrents its waay better!

just saw movie, fucking badass

Clown

you stupid idiot you know absolutely nothing try watching a fucking interview with his wife. eat shit, richard kuklinsky is a hero

kneel before zod!

Saw this just right now, I must say it's a very good movie. Would of enjoyed it more if it was longer and showed more out of his life from when he was a little kid. But good movie :D

He nearly killed his wife by stabbing her in the back.  He also caused her to have miscarriages and his children lived in constant fear of him.  Yeah, he was a stone cold psychopath.  He sometimes murdered on impulse and not for money.  He insisted in interviews, though, that he never killed women and children and thought of himself as a good family man.The movie may not be glorifying him, but depicting his self-delusions.

U sure got a shitty grammar 

hahaha rofl, clearly you dont understand acting hahahah 

   rarbg.com/torrent/gmf6v32

Wow it wasn't like this AT ALL. Not even gonna pirate it.

*sole purpose

"Look at this. We could have rebuilt Krypton on this planet, but you chose the humans over us. I exist only to protect Krypton. That is the soul purpose for which I was born. And every action I take, no matter how violent or how cruel, is for the greater good of my people. And now, I have no people. My soul, that is what you have taken from me!"

stfu dad

do i get a free virus to ?

A bit of an unnecessary Foul mouthed reaction don't you think? And by the way, using language like that just shows that you're of inferior Intelligence. 


stfu faggot.......we wont have tbp because of kooks like you......noob cunt

Watch this /watch?v=QBS4iKvBj6c the interview of the real iceman an evil bastard who clearly didn't care and felt nothing when he killed. But they do clear up why hes like it 9/10 its always the genes and the way you are brought up 

even sounds like him, a scary man!

You Know what...some of yous wouldn't know talent if it slapped you in you f..in face. Just seen the movie. Didn't like Michael Shannon till I watched this. He adapted perfectly for this role. And let's face it...he could easily play a psyco's role. He has that kinda face. This movie just lacked the right marketing and the screenplay could've been rearranged a lil better. Just seemed like they could've expanded more on his killing sprees..I mean... the guy was active from '48 - '86. 

Just saw this movie, holy fucking shit Michael Shannon is an AMAZING actor.

keep trolling bro :) 

U sure got a shitty taste

How could they fuck up such a film? SHITTY casting ,mediocre script, winona sucks ass , Michael Shannon is mediocre and not up to the task, Mr Softee is a strong character yet downplayed in the script and the actor is mediocre. A shitty job all around- was really sadened cause that psychopath's story could have been an oscar movie if it was done right. The documentary outperfoms the movie

piratebay sons

go for it


fuck no micheal shannon is one of the worst actors that ever lived lmao 

Great movie, one of my favorites.

seems awesome, i must watch xD

damn near oscar like performance as a damn comic book villain, that says it all.

real ice cold badass.

yify,

no


He did. He was a sociopath and killed when he needed to. We do glorify these guys because ultimately Kuklinski was a serial killer who happened to find the right work at the right time. He practiced and perfect the art of the kill and was a real hitman. A byproduct of Gangland and all its excesses.  

It's that crazy German doctor!

Take a hike!

this movie was crap I expected to see more killings. Read the book its way better

"I dont kill women or children" and that's how America glorifies killers, puts them in the limelight, and expect us to go "WOW HE'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD GUY! KILLING THOSE BAD DUDES AND STUFF" by somehow making one human life more important than the next through the brainwashing of children and women being more important than men. Oh I forgot, because we're in front lines in war our lives are more expendable. Gotta love it. Chances are he probably did kill his share of women.

I hate trailers that spoil the entire story.

Nobody said he was a good person. 

yeah its kind of like dexter, the executives were worried people wouldnt like the movie as much if their wasn't any relation to kuklinkski

Just watched the Blu-Ray and I loved it. I didn't get a chance to see it in cinemas buts it's defiantly in my top 5 of the year so far

Michael Ironside IS Kuklinski 

You could also say that  he doesn't deserve a book about him either then?

It's a story. People like stories, if you don't like the story being told, don't watch or read it. 

Like butter

Can anyone tell me what is the name of music in the start of movie?
Great movie by the way!

great movie !!

Had computers since I was 5 and I'm 15 today, so lol nope. Dunno if you can type anything considering your english is just as horrible like a african with aids.

it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be but I still enjoyed the movie it's definitely worth a watch Shannon is damn good too

being famous and a star are two different things. If you become a serial killer odds are you won't be around to watch a movie about you... you'll be dead or in jail most likely

lol u trolled urself kid 

i have been using torrents for years, never had one virus

i guess u are just new to computers 

you mean parrot bay?


very good movie

Pirate Bay in other tab?

I took me awhile to recognize Christ, Omg :D 

This movie was good

hmmm.. they can't show every fucking thing the movies man.. But yeah you are right anyway ;) This is the first time I have heard about child hanging out of her wife... So sad that children gets abused, he got abused by his family and he passed his abusing to his and so on.. This fucking world will never heal.. But great movie anyway.. By the way you should learn that movies is never as the truth! they want to earn money and make it a little better than the orginal like always.. failing or not..

We know, but remember, its a movie...

There are many statements from his family..one simple google search that took a few seconds brings up an interview with barbara kuklinski from 2008 in the scotsman entitled 'The hitman and her: Barbara Kuklinski' 

Baby hanging out of her? What are you on crack?

There's no statement from him or his family saying that he beat his pregnant wife. He beat her, yes, but not to the point that his unborn child was hanging from his wife's vagina. That's absurd for you to say that's the "real" story.

Hitler murdered millions yet there's a movie about him every 2 years. You do not decide who about a movie is made.

and thats how murders become stars..if i will kill 200 ppl i believe they will make a movie about me as well..should i consider?

There's two full length documentaries where he admits all of his crimes. He was not a nice man, and he says as much. That being said, I still want to see this movie. I'll just keep in mind that it's a heavy fictionalized version of the true events.

If you do a bit of research on the net instead of talking smack on youtube you would know that he actually killed 2 of his unborn children from beatings he gave his wife. His own wife has stated that this was the case and it is also backed up with medical records at the time.


You say read the book to get the "Real" story and that the move is a load of crap.. How do you know that the book is the real story, were you there? the truth of film and books of this kind is that you will never know the full truth.. There is always oversights, lies and embellishment on all parts.. So don't act like you know the truth please, the only people who do are Kuklinski and his family.. Everyone will have their own opinion and that's it..

just finished watching this movie. Fucking phenomenal! I know Kuklinski was the definition of evil, but I loved how the movie shows that even he has a human side. I know a lot of people find this movie controversial as hell & Kuklinski didn't deserve a movie about him, but I still loved it.
Michael Shannon is excellent

Is this movie out

he is not considered a psychopath 

Agreed! This movie looks insanely screwed up. Glorifying killers...it's horrible and I have no respect for it.

Okay, so he's wrong. Not ALL torrent downloads give you viruses. Songs, movies, pictures and archives can't really give you viruses. But you better bet your ass that executable files for programs and video games (and the cracks, more often) sure can, and it's common enough and pretty well-known by now I'd figure. So before you flip a lid, realize that while he wasn't totally right, he sort of was.

Michael Shannon killed it as kulkinski!!!

General Zod!!

nothing like the book/docu sorry it sucked

Could have made a movie rooting for his wife? Anyway, the movie is made and by all the reviews it will flop.

Yeah and that probably is the "movie side" of things. It's tough to have a story when there's nobody to root for.

Very true but if you watch this trailer they are very much trying to portray him for something he wasn't, like some kind of victim standing up for the family he loved and that is utter nonsense...THAT is what I was commenting on.


It's not about whether he deserved a movie made about him or not. The messed up truth is that ppl are interested in these monsters. People like Ed Gein, Jeffery Domer, Adolf Hitler. We think to ourselves, "How could somebody do such a thing?" and then we watch movies about them and read about them in hopes of better understanding their deranged minds. What exactly creates a monster how do these ppl see the world? Their perception is obviously very different from that of a normal person.

just watched the movie and it wasn't NEARLY as interesting as the real story.  Good acting, terrible story telling.

retard

i watched the documentary and red some articels , there was never something like that stated. 
can give a link or something ?

one of the best movies of 2013

get anitvirus software then you fucking idiot torrents dont give you viruses unless your a fucking retard as you no doubt are they have systems in place for people to vote down a torrent kind of like your dumb ass comment

not very accurate to the real story they should have done it more like how it happend it would have come out better

what a load of crap! Read the book by Anthony Bruno called The Iceman to get the real story behind Kuklinski. He was an evil psychopath who murder on a whim and terrorised his family. He once beat his pregnant wife so hard the unborn child was hanging out of her and consequently died.
A man like that does not deserve a movie made of him!!

Zod?

I've been torrenting my whole damn life and never got infected even once.

Not gonna flame you like most other people on the net will, but just letting you know that if you know a bit about computers you can 100% of the time protect yourself from viruses.
Thing is many people don't know how to use computers and click on stupid ads (e.g. you are 999th visitor you won 1 million USD) or complete stupid surveys, download FAKE torrents etc.
If you know your way around, you'll be fine.
Same in real life - careful who you trust or you'll get stabbed in the back.

I thought they did a great job of showing the unresolvable contradiction: how the fuck can this doting family man, be a mass murderer. He showed a different side to his family, that's for sure. Shannon is probably the best actor working right now, he is better than veterans. Just when you thought he was all about nerd freakouts, he nails this part which involves a blue collar, ancient like... fucking werewolf. Anyway, I'd like to see anyone in the world disrespect Shannon. He always kills it.

i was kinda disappointed by this movie. they tried to show the iceman from a more human side which in my opinion totally neglected his montrous side. if you watch the iceman interviews with the real guy it becomes clear that he is such a dark person and i know he must have seemed softer to his family and friends but in my opinion the movie didn't really put a lot of effort into showing that psychopatchic side.

in my opinion, yes, it is worth buying. it was really good!

This movie was great! I always loved crime dramas. It was a really good gangster flick.

Is this a good movie? Is it worth the buy?

like 100 movies over the past 3 years have been downloaded and no problems on macbook or pc.

"piracy is a crime"

gay

piracy is a crime


I knew the Mr Softee guy i made fun of his son and he threw a milkshake all over me, i was 13. He was a coward.

Yeah, I hate myself, I'm disgusted by myself. I detest myself and not to mention that I'm corrupted in my brain.. :(

I downloaded thousands of torrents, 0 viruses so far. 

"don't go full retard" 

The most mainstream comment youtube or any global website ever seen.

Yeah, I know, I'm complete retard.

Already did, sorry bro.

This looks interesting. Winona Ryder is in so I might check it out. Michael Shannon is untouchable, ok?

dont go full retard

goooooooooood movie


one of the best movies i have watched this year, if not the best..

Very poorly written and more importantly directed movie considering the vast amount of material these guys had to work from.

ZOOOOOOD! KRYPTON

that means its "impossible" to receive viruses over torrents if you have a brain superior to that of a goldfish. i wish you good luck in the ocean, watch out for the bigger fish

Exactly.

only if you are a retard who doesnt read comments and picks torrents with 1 seeder

You've been inside your room for too long, I must advice you to step out and experience real life for a change.

No, I am saying that it is "possible" to receive viruses over torrents.

Beautiful film.
Thanks YIFY & PB <3

This movie is really really good, Iceman was a crazy mothafucka, didn't think twice about killin someone

You have nothing to worry about when downloading torrents.SMH i dont know what you are trying to do here.I have been downloading since 6 years,Its limewire that gives viruses and fucksup your computer.Im guessing you are the dumbfuck that used it?

Dont troll a troll.You fucking dick blower,Go waste your time on 9gag.

Torrents can give you viruses, you must be new to the internet :)

Verry guud

I am not mad!!!! no no no no!!! You are mad for saying torrents give you virus hahahahahhaha fucking terrorist

Don't be mad my little dear friend, I meant no harm in this comments, I'm not a terrorist from another planet. I PROMISE

damn this trailer suck , movie is much better! 

When??


the only virus you got is HIV when your whore mother gave birth to you hahaha cocksucker :P *puts on sunglasses

Plain and simple just like that

Oh!!! you blow your father with that mouth??The language on this fuck!! huhh

Shit Polish!!!Keep away from them

Bye, troll lvl : Newbie

Gods!!! Youre an idiot!Now you are also quite like a church mouse.Hehehehe go back and turn parental control on heheheeheheh and enjoy netflix.How much was it 15 dollars..uhh and ill download samething for free.While you say ill get virus.Just like religious people say to atheists youll go to hell..hehehheheheheheh bye loser.hehehehehe

I hate itunes and I hate netflix the people who use them don't know anything about the internet or technology. They're people who act like they do but pay a lot of money to have a company do it for them.

WATCH it its a good movie

No they dont!!torrents are completely safe you fairy!

Torrents dont give you viruses.Being a dumb fuck can.No torrent ive ever downloaded has given me a malware or virus.You are a stupid guy who thinks everyone pays for online services.

You are the biggest,umm no not the biggest idiot but yeah in the top league of the biggest idiots ive met online.Saying torrents give you virus is like saying drinking too much water can mess up with your kidneys.You fucking cocksucker every single motherfucker on here on this page would shit down your throat for your stupid comment about torrents.Wait tommorow and see them thumbs go boom.

No they don't <.<, learn to download from the right pages instead of some shitty site. YOU should get your shit straight.

Dunno if you're retarded or just trolling.

But Netflix cost about 10-15 US dollars per month.
And yes, torrents give you viruses. Please get your shit straight man.

And what Tv shows have you been watching my fucktard dear?fucking loser

you rich happy go lucky ignorant ass urban cock sucker!!not many people use itunes or netflix.And who the fuck told you torrents can give virus.HAHAHAHHAAHAHAHHHAHA Who the fuck told you that??Kill him hhahahahahhahhaah cant stop laughing...

I hate trailers that spoil the entire story.

Nobody said he was a good person. 

yeah its kind of like dexter, the executives were worried people wouldnt like the movie as much if their wasn't any relation to kuklinkski

Just watched the Blu-Ray and I loved it. I didn't get a chance to see it in cinemas buts it's defiantly in my top 5 of the year so far

Michael Ironside IS Kuklinski 

You could also say that  he doesn't deserve a book about him either then?

It's a story. People like stories, if you don't like the story being told, don't watch or read it. 

Like butter

Can anyone tell me what is the name of music in the start of movie?
Great movie by the way!

great movie !!

Had computers since I was 5 and I'm 15 today, so lol nope. Dunno if you can type anything considering your english is just as horrible like a african with aids.

it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be but I still enjoyed the movie it's definitely worth a watch Shannon is damn good too

being famous and a star are two different things. If you become a serial killer odds are you won't be around to watch a movie about you... you'll be dead or in jail most likely

lol u trolled urself kid 

i have been using torrents for years, never had one virus

i guess u are just new to computers 

you mean parrot bay?


very good movie

Pirate Bay in other tab?

I took me awhile to recognize Christ, Omg :D 

This movie was good

hmmm.. they can't show every fucking thing the movies man.. But yeah you are right anyway ;) This is the first time I have heard about child hanging out of her wife... So sad that children gets abused, he got abused by his family and he passed his abusing to his and so on.. This fucking world will never heal.. But great movie anyway.. By the way you should learn that movies is never as the truth! they want to earn money and make it a little better than the orginal like always.. failing or not..

We know, but remember, its a movie...

There are many statements from his family..one simple google search that took a few seconds brings up an interview with barbara kuklinski from 2008 in the scotsman entitled 'The hitman and her: Barbara Kuklinski' 

Baby hanging out of her? What are you on crack?

There's no statement from him or his family saying that he beat his pregnant wife. He beat her, yes, but not to the point that his unborn child was hanging from his wife's vagina. That's absurd for you to say that's the "real" story.

Hitler murdered millions yet there's a movie about him every 2 years. You do not decide who about a movie is made.

and thats how murders become stars..if i will kill 200 ppl i believe they will make a movie about me as well..should i consider?

There's two full length documentaries where he admits all of his crimes. He was not a nice man, and he says as much. That being said, I still want to see this movie. I'll just keep in mind that it's a heavy fictionalized version of the true events.

If you do a bit of research on the net instead of talking smack on youtube you would know that he actually killed 2 of his unborn children from beatings he gave his wife. His own wife has stated that this was the case and it is also backed up with medical records at the time.


You say read the book to get the "Real" story and that the move is a load of crap.. How do you know that the book is the real story, were you there? the truth of film and books of this kind is that you will never know the full truth.. There is always oversights, lies and embellishment on all parts.. So don't act like you know the truth please, the only people who do are Kuklinski and his family.. Everyone will have their own opinion and that's it..

just finished watching this movie. Fucking phenomenal! I know Kuklinski was the definition of evil, but I loved how the movie shows that even he has a human side. I know a lot of people find this movie controversial as hell & Kuklinski didn't deserve a movie about him, but I still loved it.
Michael Shannon is excellent

Is this movie out

he is not considered a psychopath 

Agreed! This movie looks insanely screwed up. Glorifying killers...it's horrible and I have no respect for it.

Okay, so he's wrong. Not ALL torrent downloads give you viruses. Songs, movies, pictures and archives can't really give you viruses. But you better bet your ass that executable files for programs and video games (and the cracks, more often) sure can, and it's common enough and pretty well-known by now I'd figure. So before you flip a lid, realize that while he wasn't totally right, he sort of was.

Michael Shannon killed it as kulkinski!!!

They better make this good cause RIchard was a pathalogical liar and a constant wife beater. This movie makes him such a family man and not the cold blooded killer he is in real life. 

crazy good movie!

Deffo recommend- on par with films such as Goodfellas and the departed

I hope there is a scene in this movie where Michael Shannon freaks out and tells everyone off like in his other movies, he is so awesome at that

 I Will FIND HIM!

You and 49 other idiots.. Join Miley Cirus.

Its Greg boule guys!

Omg Why not leave the name of the movie for the SUper hero... Jesus!!!

Anyone else is here because they have seen ZOD in MAN OF STEEL? Well, I am:)

no me ha gustado el protagonista que interpreta a RICHARD KUKLINSKI tiene sentimientos hacia los que mata y el kuklinski real ha dicho siempre que el nunca sintio nada hacia las personas que asesinaba

Hentai, oh really?

Enjoy your viruses 

There is a interview with the real ice man on youtube, He is fucked up 

yify bought use here

The film was okay. The lead played Richard fine. However, the film seem to paint him in an anti-hero type of light, when he was a cold blooded murderer who enjoyed killing. One of the most cruel murders they left out, was when he killed an innocent man waiting for a bus with his new crossbow, just to see if it worked. And it didn't show how he would savagely beat his wife and daughters. If film also didn't show how he would set a lot of guys up with fake deals, then killed and robbed them. 

Yah, they did miss a lot.  Still not sure how they could have fit it all in.  Even if half of what Kuklinski said was true, this would have had to be a 4 hour film just to get half of that in.  

Still, the director seemed to water it down, but Shannon carried this film superbly.  If the story were stronger, this would have been an epic movie.

Shannon carried this film with true force.  He seems to have that air of intensity that the book generates around Kuklinski, and his eyes alone speak much of the best dialogue.  You dont see many actors who can do that.  The story could have been better done, but it would have been extraordinarily tough given it covers 20 years.

The actor made this film, and does it well enough for me to still be pretty damned good.  Many people expected a ficton mob thriller.  This was a true story adaptation.

Based on a true story, not a documentary.  You dumb illiterate fucks.

is this a talk talk movie or action?

Noobs, I use xbmc with icefilms :D

Michael Shannon is amazing. He has this unique magnetism like R. de Niro. You just want to watch him as he acts. I hope Micheal will involve himself in even more requiring roles. His potential is outstanding!

Wonderful movie! <3

They never showed kuklinskis sick sense of humour in the film, not even once :( its still pretty good tho

GO HOME ZOD YOU ARE DRUNK

the movie was a disipointment miss out loads of key points and murders. 
1.the murder of the shot gun what blows his the mans face off at the red lights.
2.the one where the men tryed to run him off the road and he got out his car and killed all 4 of the men.
3.where they had the bet when he shot the man in the adams apple. 

sorry for bad grammar :) 

You.. are completely correct!
I too wanted to see this film, but what the fuck?
Seriously garbage film made with money in sight only. The re-made the true story to fit how a film should be. Not how reality was.

If you really need to see this film then I encourage everyone to just download this film and spread it illegal so moviecreator do not get money.
Watch "Confessions of a mafia hitman" instead. Its THE only way to see Kuklinski. 

Thumbs up for Silverhourse comment

Your statement is so wrong. Its not a great film, its shit. Utter fking shit. Moviecreator is bending the truth in this film. But no matter what, you are truly wrong. He beat his wife several times. According to himself, he felt most happiness when beeing home with his family, but it didnt stop him from beeing him. A monster who did not care when it came to cruelty.

His family broke all contact. Says it all. So read up better on the story cause ur wrong. "Confessions of a mafia hitman" (1992).

Youtube searchfield; "Confessions of a mafia hitman"
Better to have it without it taking up any space.

Do not watch this film legit, download it! Dont give maker any money for bending the truth when he could have made the true story.

Why is he suddenly a loving father and husband in this film? In "Confessions of a mafia hitman" you see his wife and its pretty hard to miss how her nose has been broken several times. 

The mafia may have gotten interest in Kuklinski, but they had absolutly nothing to do with his first murder or how he turned bad.  Watch 'Confessions of a mafia hitman' instead!

Scenetime reporting in

haha me too xD 

Any luck ? 

He may have had three kids? but how are you gunner know that he dint flip out on his wife? he isn't gunner tell every single detail off his life is he.

kickass is kickass

I have watched every documentary and read every book about Richard Kuklinski. I have to say I was real excited about this movie when it came out. But....They completely dropped the ball on this one. There were a few parts that were true to the books and documentaries. But the rest was just not there it lacked the kuklinski flare. I think they should get another big name movie company and redo this one from the ground up. Use the books use the documentaries and redo the film.

Zod kills captain america in this! lol great movie

never mind the movie is already out on youtube lol

Saw the whole documentary, cant wait to see how they pull this off!!

So you are THAT guy.


Not really

somone say what is that song called in movie,when they killed that guy in club with spray.


General Zod + Captain America = The Iceman

Nowhere close to being as good as the book!

Still made a pretty fucking good movie.

the movie missed out his whole childhood from the book.

Mine is Viooz <3

This was surprisingly a really good movie! some things embellished but over all, a great job!

THIS IS A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT!!! YOU COULD WATCH THIS MOVIE FREE WITHOUT DOWNLOAD ON VIOOZ.COM

I WILL FIND HIM !!!

great film, but he had three kids, not even two and he never flipped out on his wife and busted up their kitchen

His voice is the same? He,s a stone cold killer!

good movie! wished they showed more though, like when he was young instead of jumping right onto the middle of the plot. But still a good movie.

swj ch?op !!

mine also hahaha


anyone know where to get we're the millers or wat


Michael Shannon is an outstanding actor 

I tohught It was gonna be an ICEMAN, like Yeti or sometihng.....I have such childish exceptations

Good job, im sure he raised you better! Were you raised or thrown up?

hahaha true


after seen the documentary first i have to say it was more intense than the slightly rushed and cramped film. 

Hahah you know me too well!

Actually kickass torrents its waay better!

just saw movie, fucking badass

Clown

you stupid idiot you know absolutely nothing try watching a fucking interview with his wife. eat shit, richard kuklinsky is a hero

kneel before zod!

Saw this just right now, I must say it's a very good movie. Would of enjoyed it more if it was longer and showed more out of his life from when he was a little kid. But good movie :D

He nearly killed his wife by stabbing her in the back.  He also caused her to have miscarriages and his children lived in constant fear of him.  Yeah, he was a stone cold psychopath.  He sometimes murdered on impulse and not for money.  He insisted in interviews, though, that he never killed women and children and thought of himself as a good family man.The movie may not be glorifying him, but depicting his self-delusions.

U sure got a shitty grammar 

hahaha rofl, clearly you dont understand acting hahahah 

   rarbg.com/torrent/gmf6v32

Wow it wasn't like this AT ALL. Not even gonna pirate it.

*sole purpose

"Look at this. We could have rebuilt Krypton on this planet, but you chose the humans over us. I exist only to protect Krypton. That is the soul purpose for which I was born. And every action I take, no matter how violent or how cruel, is for the greater good of my people. And now, I have no people. My soul, that is what you have taken from me!"

stfu dad

do i get a free virus to ?

A bit of an unnecessary Foul mouthed reaction don't you think? And by the way, using language like that just shows that you're of inferior Intelligence. 


stfu faggot.......we wont have tbp because of kooks like you......noob cunt

Watch this /watch?v=QBS4iKvBj6c the interview of the real iceman an evil bastard who clearly didn't care and felt nothing when he killed. But they do clear up why hes like it 9/10 its always the genes and the way you are brought up 

even sounds like him, a scary man!

You Know what...some of yous wouldn't know talent if it slapped you in you f..in face. Just seen the movie. Didn't like Michael Shannon till I watched this. He adapted perfectly for this role. And let's face it...he could easily play a psyco's role. He has that kinda face. This movie just lacked the right marketing and the screenplay could've been rearranged a lil better. Just seemed like they could've expanded more on his killing sprees..I mean... the guy was active from '48 - '86. 

Just saw this movie, holy fucking shit Michael Shannon is an AMAZING actor.

keep trolling bro :) 

U sure got a shitty taste

How could they fuck up such a film? SHITTY casting ,mediocre script, winona sucks ass , Michael Shannon is mediocre and not up to the task, Mr Softee is a strong character yet downplayed in the script and the actor is mediocre. A shitty job all around- was really sadened cause that psychopath's story could have been an oscar movie if it was done right. The documentary outperfoms the movie

piratebay sons

go for it


fuck no micheal shannon is one of the worst actors that ever lived lmao 

Great movie, one of my favorites.

seems awesome, i must watch xD

damn near oscar like performance as a damn comic book villain, that says it all.

real ice cold badass.

yify,

no


He did. He was a sociopath and killed when he needed to. We do glorify these guys because ultimately Kuklinski was a serial killer who happened to find the right work at the right time. He practiced and perfect the art of the kill and was a real hitman. A byproduct of Gangland and all its excesses.  

It's that crazy German doctor!

Take a hike!

this movie was crap I expected to see more killings. Read the book its way better

"I dont kill women or children" and that's how America glorifies killers, puts them in the limelight, and expect us to go "WOW HE'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD GUY! KILLING THOSE BAD DUDES AND STUFF" by somehow making one human life more important than the next through the brainwashing of children and women being more important than men. Oh I forgot, because we're in front lines in war our lives are more expendable. Gotta love it. Chances are he probably did kill his share of women.

8 inches.....

They better make this good cause RIchard was a pathalogical liar and a constant wife beater. This movie makes him such a family man and not the cold blooded killer he is in real life. 

crazy good movie!

Deffo recommend- on par with films such as Goodfellas and the departed

I hope there is a scene in this movie where Michael Shannon freaks out and tells everyone off like in his other movies, he is so awesome at that

 I Will FIND HIM!

You and 49 other idiots.. Join Miley Cirus.

Its Greg boule guys!

Omg Why not leave the name of the movie for the SUper hero... Jesus!!!

Anyone else is here because they have seen ZOD in MAN OF STEEL? Well, I am:)

no me ha gustado el protagonista que interpreta a RICHARD KUKLINSKI tiene sentimientos hacia los que mata y el kuklinski real ha dicho siempre que el nunca sintio nada hacia las personas que asesinaba

Hentai, oh really?

Enjoy your viruses 

There is a interview with the real ice man on youtube, He is fucked up 

yify bought use here

The film was okay. The lead played Richard fine. However, the film seem to paint him in an anti-hero type of light, when he was a cold blooded murderer who enjoyed killing. One of the most cruel murders they left out, was when he killed an innocent man waiting for a bus with his new crossbow, just to see if it worked. And it didn't show how he would savagely beat his wife and daughters. If film also didn't show how he would set a lot of guys up with fake deals, then killed and robbed them. 

Yah, they did miss a lot.  Still not sure how they could have fit it all in.  Even if half of what Kuklinski said was true, this would have had to be a 4 hour film just to get half of that in.  

Still, the director seemed to water it down, but Shannon carried this film superbly.  If the story were stronger, this would have been an epic movie.

Shannon carried this film with true force.  He seems to have that air of intensity that the book generates around Kuklinski, and his eyes alone speak much of the best dialogue.  You dont see many actors who can do that.  The story could have been better done, but it would have been extraordinarily tough given it covers 20 years.

The actor made this film, and does it well enough for me to still be pretty damned good.  Many people expected a ficton mob thriller.  This was a true story adaptation.

Based on a true story, not a documentary.  You dumb illiterate fucks.

is this a talk talk movie or action?

Noobs, I use xbmc with icefilms :D

Michael Shannon is amazing. He has this unique magnetism like R. de Niro. You just want to watch him as he acts. I hope Micheal will involve himself in even more requiring roles. His potential is outstanding!

Wonderful movie! <3

They never showed kuklinskis sick sense of humour in the film, not even once :( its still pretty good tho

GO HOME ZOD YOU ARE DRUNK

the movie was a disipointment miss out loads of key points and murders. 
1.the murder of the shot gun what blows his the mans face off at the red lights.
2.the one where the men tryed to run him off the road and he got out his car and killed all 4 of the men.
3.where they had the bet when he shot the man in the adams apple. 

sorry for bad grammar :) 

You.. are completely correct!
I too wanted to see this film, but what the fuck?
Seriously garbage film made with money in sight only. The re-made the true story to fit how a film should be. Not how reality was.

If you really need to see this film then I encourage everyone to just download this film and spread it illegal so moviecreator do not get money.
Watch "Confessions of a mafia hitman" instead. Its THE only way to see Kuklinski. 

Thumbs up for Silverhourse comment

Your statement is so wrong. Its not a great film, its shit. Utter fking shit. Moviecreator is bending the truth in this film. But no matter what, you are truly wrong. He beat his wife several times. According to himself, he felt most happiness when beeing home with his family, but it didnt stop him from beeing him. A monster who did not care when it came to cruelty.

His family broke all contact. Says it all. So read up better on the story cause ur wrong. "Confessions of a mafia hitman" (1992).

Youtube searchfield; "Confessions of a mafia hitman"
Better to have it without it taking up any space.

Do not watch this film legit, download it! Dont give maker any money for bending the truth when he could have made the true story.

Why is he suddenly a loving father and husband in this film? In "Confessions of a mafia hitman" you see his wife and its pretty hard to miss how her nose has been broken several times. 

The mafia may have gotten interest in Kuklinski, but they had absolutly nothing to do with his first murder or how he turned bad.  Watch 'Confessions of a mafia hitman' instead!

Scenetime reporting in

haha me too xD 

Any luck ? 

He may have had three kids? but how are you gunner know that he dint flip out on his wife? he isn't gunner tell every single detail off his life is he.

kickass is kickass

I have watched every documentary and read every book about Richard Kuklinski. I have to say I was real excited about this movie when it came out. But....They completely dropped the ball on this one. There were a few parts that were true to the books and documentaries. But the rest was just not there it lacked the kuklinski flare. I think they should get another big name movie company and redo this one from the ground up. Use the books use the documentaries and redo the film.

Zod kills captain america in this! lol great movie

never mind the movie is already out on youtube lol

Saw the whole documentary, cant wait to see how they pull this off!!

So you are THAT guy.


Not really

somone say what is that song called in movie,when they killed that guy in club with spray.


General Zod + Captain America = The Iceman

Nowhere close to being as good as the book!

Still made a pretty fucking good movie.

the movie missed out his whole childhood from the book.

Mine is Viooz <3

This was surprisingly a really good movie! some things embellished but over all, a great job!

THIS IS A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT!!! YOU COULD WATCH THIS MOVIE FREE WITHOUT DOWNLOAD ON VIOOZ.COM

I WILL FIND HIM !!!

great film, but he had three kids, not even two and he never flipped out on his wife and busted up their kitchen

His voice is the same? He,s a stone cold killer!

good movie! wished they showed more though, like when he was young instead of jumping right onto the middle of the plot. But still a good movie.

swj ch?op !!

mine also hahaha


anyone know where to get we're the millers or wat


Michael Shannon is an outstanding actor 

I tohught It was gonna be an ICEMAN, like Yeti or sometihng.....I have such childish exceptations

Good job, im sure he raised you better! Were you raised or thrown up?

hahaha true


after seen the documentary first i have to say it was more intense than the slightly rushed and cramped film. 

Hahah you know me too well!

Actually kickass torrents its waay better!

just saw movie, fucking badass

Clown

you stupid idiot you know absolutely nothing try watching a fucking interview with his wife. eat shit, richard kuklinsky is a hero

kneel before zod!

Saw this just right now, I must say it's a very good movie. Would of enjoyed it more if it was longer and showed more out of his life from when he was a little kid. But good movie :D

He nearly killed his wife by stabbing her in the back.  He also caused her to have miscarriages and his children lived in constant fear of him.  Yeah, he was a stone cold psychopath.  He sometimes murdered on impulse and not for money.  He insisted in interviews, though, that he never killed women and children and thought of himself as a good family man.The movie may not be glorifying him, but depicting his self-delusions.

U sure got a shitty grammar 

hahaha rofl, clearly you dont understand acting hahahah 

   rarbg.com/torrent/gmf6v32

Wow it wasn't like this AT ALL. Not even gonna pirate it.

*sole purpose

"Look at this. We could have rebuilt Krypton on this planet, but you chose the humans over us. I exist only to protect Krypton. That is the soul purpose for which I was born. And every action I take, no matter how violent or how cruel, is for the greater good of my people. And now, I have no people. My soul, that is what you have taken from me!"

stfu dad

do i get a free virus to ?

A bit of an unnecessary Foul mouthed reaction don't you think? And by the way, using language like that just shows that you're of inferior Intelligence. 


stfu faggot.......we wont have tbp because of kooks like you......noob cunt

Watch this /watch?v=QBS4iKvBj6c the interview of the real iceman an evil bastard who clearly didn't care and felt nothing when he killed. But they do clear up why hes like it 9/10 its always the genes and the way you are brought up 

even sounds like him, a scary man!

You Know what...some of yous wouldn't know talent if it slapped you in you f..in face. Just seen the movie. Didn't like Michael Shannon till I watched this. He adapted perfectly for this role. And let's face it...he could easily play a psyco's role. He has that kinda face. This movie just lacked the right marketing and the screenplay could've been rearranged a lil better. Just seemed like they could've expanded more on his killing sprees..I mean... the guy was active from '48 - '86. 

Just saw this movie, holy fucking shit Michael Shannon is an AMAZING actor.

keep trolling bro :) 

U sure got a shitty taste

How could they fuck up such a film? SHITTY casting ,mediocre script, winona sucks ass , Michael Shannon is mediocre and not up to the task, Mr Softee is a strong character yet downplayed in the script and the actor is mediocre. A shitty job all around- was really sadened cause that psychopath's story could have been an oscar movie if it was done right. The documentary outperfoms the movie

piratebay sons

go for it


fuck no micheal shannon is one of the worst actors that ever lived lmao 

Great movie, one of my favorites.

seems awesome, i must watch xD

damn near oscar like performance as a damn comic book villain, that says it all.

real ice cold badass.

yify,

no


He did. He was a sociopath and killed when he needed to. We do glorify these guys because ultimately Kuklinski was a serial killer who happened to find the right work at the right time. He practiced and perfect the art of the kill and was a real hitman. A byproduct of Gangland and all its excesses.  

It's that crazy German doctor!

Take a hike!

this movie was crap I expected to see more killings. Read the book its way better

"I dont kill women or children" and that's how America glorifies killers, puts them in the limelight, and expect us to go "WOW HE'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD GUY! KILLING THOSE BAD DUDES AND STUFF" by somehow making one human life more important than the next through the brainwashing of children and women being more important than men. Oh I forgot, because we're in front lines in war our lives are more expendable. Gotta love it. Chances are he probably did kill his share of women.

I hate trailers that spoil the entire story.

Nobody said he was a good person. 

yeah its kind of like dexter, the executives were worried people wouldnt like the movie as much if their wasn't any relation to kuklinkski

Just watched the Blu-Ray and I loved it. I didn't get a chance to see it in cinemas buts it's defiantly in my top 5 of the year so far

Michael Ironside IS Kuklinski 

You could also say that  he doesn't deserve a book about him either then?

It's a story. People like stories, if you don't like the story being told, don't watch or read it. 

Like butter

Can anyone tell me what is the name of music in the start of movie?
Great movie by the way!

great movie !!

Had computers since I was 5 and I'm 15 today, so lol nope. Dunno if you can type anything considering your english is just as horrible like a african with aids.

it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be but I still enjoyed the movie it's definitely worth a watch Shannon is damn good too

being famous and a star are two different things. If you become a serial killer odds are you won't be around to watch a movie about you... you'll be dead or in jail most likely

lol u trolled urself kid 

i have been using torrents for years, never had one virus

i guess u are just new to computers 

you mean parrot bay?


very good movie

Pirate Bay in other tab?

I took me awhile to recognize Christ, Omg :D 

This movie was good

hmmm.. they can't show every fucking thing the movies man.. But yeah you are right anyway ;) This is the first time I have heard about child hanging out of her wife... So sad that children gets abused, he got abused by his family and he passed his abusing to his and so on.. This fucking world will never heal.. But great movie anyway.. By the way you should learn that movies is never as the truth! they want to earn money and make it a little better than the orginal like always.. failing or not..

We know, but remember, its a movie...

There are many statements from his family..one simple google search that took a few seconds brings up an interview with barbara kuklinski from 2008 in the scotsman entitled 'The hitman and her: Barbara Kuklinski' 

Baby hanging out of her? What are you on crack?

There's no statement from him or his family saying that he beat his pregnant wife. He beat her, yes, but not to the point that his unborn child was hanging from his wife's vagina. That's absurd for you to say that's the "real" story.

Hitler murdered millions yet there's a movie about him every 2 years. You do not decide who about a movie is made.

and thats how murders become stars..if i will kill 200 ppl i believe they will make a movie about me as well..should i consider?

There's two full length documentaries where he admits all of his crimes. He was not a nice man, and he says as much. That being said, I still want to see this movie. I'll just keep in mind that it's a heavy fictionalized version of the true events.

If you do a bit of research on the net instead of talking smack on youtube you would know that he actually killed 2 of his unborn children from beatings he gave his wife. His own wife has stated that this was the case and it is also backed up with medical records at the time.


You say read the book to get the "Real" story and that the move is a load of crap.. How do you know that the book is the real story, were you there? the truth of film and books of this kind is that you will never know the full truth.. There is always oversights, lies and embellishment on all parts.. So don't act like you know the truth please, the only people who do are Kuklinski and his family.. Everyone will have their own opinion and that's it..

just finished watching this movie. Fucking phenomenal! I know Kuklinski was the definition of evil, but I loved how the movie shows that even he has a human side. I know a lot of people find this movie controversial as hell & Kuklinski didn't deserve a movie about him, but I still loved it.
Michael Shannon is excellent

Is this movie out

he is not considered a psychopath 

Agreed! This movie looks insanely screwed up. Glorifying killers...it's horrible and I have no respect for it.

Okay, so he's wrong. Not ALL torrent downloads give you viruses. Songs, movies, pictures and archives can't really give you viruses. But you better bet your ass that executable files for programs and video games (and the cracks, more often) sure can, and it's common enough and pretty well-known by now I'd figure. So before you flip a lid, realize that while he wasn't totally right, he sort of was.

Michael Shannon killed it as kulkinski!!!

General Zod!!

nothing like the book/docu sorry it sucked

Could have made a movie rooting for his wife? Anyway, the movie is made and by all the reviews it will flop.

Yeah and that probably is the "movie side" of things. It's tough to have a story when there's nobody to root for.

Very true but if you watch this trailer they are very much trying to portray him for something he wasn't, like some kind of victim standing up for the family he loved and that is utter nonsense...THAT is what I was commenting on.


It's not about whether he deserved a movie made about him or not. The messed up truth is that ppl are interested in these monsters. People like Ed Gein, Jeffery Domer, Adolf Hitler. We think to ourselves, "How could somebody do such a thing?" and then we watch movies about them and read about them in hopes of better understanding their deranged minds. What exactly creates a monster how do these ppl see the world? Their perception is obviously very different from that of a normal person.

just watched the movie and it wasn't NEARLY as interesting as the real story.  Good acting, terrible story telling.

retard

i watched the documentary and red some articels , there was never something like that stated. 
can give a link or something ?

one of the best movies of 2013

get anitvirus software then you fucking idiot torrents dont give you viruses unless your a fucking retard as you no doubt are they have systems in place for people to vote down a torrent kind of like your dumb ass comment

not very accurate to the real story they should have done it more like how it happend it would have come out better

what a load of crap! Read the book by Anthony Bruno called The Iceman to get the real story behind Kuklinski. He was an evil psychopath who murder on a whim and terrorised his family. He once beat his pregnant wife so hard the unborn child was hanging out of her and consequently died.
A man like that does not deserve a movie made of him!!

Zod?

I've been torrenting my whole damn life and never got infected even once.

Not gonna flame you like most other people on the net will, but just letting you know that if you know a bit about computers you can 100% of the time protect yourself from viruses.
Thing is many people don't know how to use computers and click on stupid ads (e.g. you are 999th visitor you won 1 million USD) or complete stupid surveys, download FAKE torrents etc.
If you know your way around, you'll be fine.
Same in real life - careful who you trust or you'll get stabbed in the back.

I thought they did a great job of showing the unresolvable contradiction: how the fuck can this doting family man, be a mass murderer. He showed a different side to his family, that's for sure. Shannon is probably the best actor working right now, he is better than veterans. Just when you thought he was all about nerd freakouts, he nails this part which involves a blue collar, ancient like... fucking werewolf. Anyway, I'd like to see anyone in the world disrespect Shannon. He always kills it.

i was kinda disappointed by this movie. they tried to show the iceman from a more human side which in my opinion totally neglected his montrous side. if you watch the iceman interviews with the real guy it becomes clear that he is such a dark person and i know he must have seemed softer to his family and friends but in my opinion the movie didn't really put a lot of effort into showing that psychopatchic side.

in my opinion, yes, it is worth buying. it was really good!

This movie was great! I always loved crime dramas. It was a really good gangster flick.

Is this a good movie? Is it worth the buy?

like 100 movies over the past 3 years have been downloaded and no problems on macbook or pc.

"piracy is a crime"

gay

piracy is a crime


I knew the Mr Softee guy i made fun of his son and he threw a milkshake all over me, i was 13. He was a coward.

Yeah, I hate myself, I'm disgusted by myself. I detest myself and not to mention that I'm corrupted in my brain.. :(

I downloaded thousands of torrents, 0 viruses so far. 

"don't go full retard" 

The most mainstream comment youtube or any global website ever seen.

Yeah, I know, I'm complete retard.

Already did, sorry bro.

This looks interesting. Winona Ryder is in so I might check it out. Michael Shannon is untouchable, ok?

dont go full retard

goooooooooood movie


one of the best movies i have watched this year, if not the best..

Very poorly written and more importantly directed movie considering the vast amount of material these guys had to work from.

ZOOOOOOD! KRYPTON

that means its "impossible" to receive viruses over torrents if you have a brain superior to that of a goldfish. i wish you good luck in the ocean, watch out for the bigger fish

Exactly.

only if you are a retard who doesnt read comments and picks torrents with 1 seeder

You've been inside your room for too long, I must advice you to step out and experience real life for a change.

No, I am saying that it is "possible" to receive viruses over torrents.

Beautiful film.
Thanks YIFY & PB <3

This movie is really really good, Iceman was a crazy mothafucka, didn't think twice about killin someone

You have nothing to worry about when downloading torrents.SMH i dont know what you are trying to do here.I have been downloading since 6 years,Its limewire that gives viruses and fucksup your computer.Im guessing you are the dumbfuck that used it?

Dont troll a troll.You fucking dick blower,Go waste your time on 9gag.

Torrents can give you viruses, you must be new to the internet :)

Verry guud

I am not mad!!!! no no no no!!! You are mad for saying torrents give you virus hahahahahhaha fucking terrorist

Plain and simple just like that

Oh!!! you blow your father with that mouth??The language on this fuck!! huhh

Shit Polish!!!Keep away from them

Bye, troll lvl : Newbie

Gods!!! Youre an idiot!Now you are also quite like a church mouse.Hehehehe go back and turn parental control on heheheeheheh and enjoy netflix.How much was it 15 dollars..uhh and ill download samething for free.While you say ill get virus.Just like religious people say to atheists youll go to hell..hehehheheheheheh bye loser.hehehehehe

I hate itunes and I hate netflix the people who use them don't know anything about the internet or technology. They're people who act like they do but pay a lot of money to have a company do it for them.

WATCH it its a good movie

No they dont!!torrents are completely safe you fairy!

Torrents dont give you viruses.Being a dumb fuck can.No torrent ive ever downloaded has given me a malware or virus.You are a stupid guy who thinks everyone pays for online services.

You are the biggest,umm no not the biggest idiot but yeah in the top league of the biggest idiots ive met online.Saying torrents give you virus is like saying drinking too much water can mess up with your kidneys.You fucking cocksucker every single motherfucker on here on this page would shit down your throat for your stupid comment about torrents.Wait tommorow and see them thumbs go boom.

No they don't <.<, learn to download from the right pages instead of some shitty site. YOU should get your shit straight.

Dunno if you're retarded or just trolling.

But Netflix cost about 10-15 US dollars per month.
And yes, torrents give you viruses. Please get your shit straight man.

And what Tv shows have you been watching my fucktard dear?fucking loser

you rich happy go lucky ignorant ass urban cock sucker!!not many people use itunes or netflix.And who the fuck told you torrents can give virus.HAHAHAHHAAHAHAHHHAHA Who the fuck told you that??Kill him hhahahahahhahhaah cant stop laughing...

I hate trailers that spoil the entire story.

Nobody said he was a good person. 

yeah its kind of like dexter, the executives were worried people wouldnt like the movie as much if their wasn't any relation to kuklinkski

Just watched the Blu-Ray and I loved it. I didn't get a chance to see it in cinemas buts it's defiantly in my top 5 of the year so far

Michael Ironside IS Kuklinski 

You could also say that  he doesn't deserve a book about him either then?

It's a story. People like stories, if you don't like the story being told, don't watch or read it. 

Like butter

Can anyone tell me what is the name of music in the start of movie?
Great movie by the way!

great movie !!

Had computers since I was 5 and I'm 15 today, so lol nope. Dunno if you can type anything considering your english is just as horrible like a african with aids.

it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be but I still enjoyed the movie it's definitely worth a watch Shannon is damn good too

being famous and a star are two different things. If you become a serial killer odds are you won't be around to watch a movie about you... you'll be dead or in jail most likely

lol u trolled urself kid 

i have been using torrents for years, never had one virus

i guess u are just new to computers 

you mean parrot bay?


very good movie

Pirate Bay in other tab?

I took me awhile to recognize Christ, Omg :D 

This movie was good

hmmm.. they can't show every fucking thing the movies man.. But yeah you are right anyway ;) This is the first time I have heard about child hanging out of her wife... So sad that children gets abused, he got abused by his family and he passed his abusing to his and so on.. This fucking world will never heal.. But great movie anyway.. By the way you should learn that movies is never as the truth! they want to earn money and make it a little better than the orginal like always.. failing or not..

We know, but remember, its a movie...

There are many statements from his family..one simple google search that took a few seconds brings up an interview with barbara kuklinski from 2008 in the scotsman entitled 'The hitman and her: Barbara Kuklinski' 

Baby hanging out of her? What are you on crack?

There's no statement from him or his family saying that he beat his pregnant wife. He beat her, yes, but not to the point that his unborn child was hanging from his wife's vagina. That's absurd for you to say that's the "real" story.

Hitler murdered millions yet there's a movie about him every 2 years. You do not decide who about a movie is made.

and thats how murders become stars..if i will kill 200 ppl i believe they will make a movie about me as well..should i consider?

There's two full length documentaries where he admits all of his crimes. He was not a nice man, and he says as much. That being said, I still want to see this movie. I'll just keep in mind that it's a heavy fictionalized version of the true events.

If you do a bit of research on the net instead of talking smack on youtube you would know that he actually killed 2 of his unborn children from beatings he gave his wife. His own wife has stated that this was the case and it is also backed up with medical records at the time.


You say read the book to get the "Real" story and that the move is a load of crap.. How do you know that the book is the real story, were you there? the truth of film and books of this kind is that you will never know the full truth.. There is always oversights, lies and embellishment on all parts.. So don't act like you know the truth please, the only people who do are Kuklinski and his family.. Everyone will have their own opinion and that's it..

just finished watching this movie. Fucking phenomenal! I know Kuklinski was the definition of evil, but I loved how the movie shows that even he has a human side. I know a lot of people find this movie controversial as hell & Kuklinski didn't deserve a movie about him, but I still loved it.
Michael Shannon is excellent

Is this movie out

he is not considered a psychopath 

Agreed! This movie looks insanely screwed up. Glorifying killers...it's horrible and I have no respect for it.

Okay, so he's wrong. Not ALL torrent downloads give you viruses. Songs, movies, pictures and archives can't really give you viruses. But you better bet your ass that executable files for programs and video games (and the cracks, more often) sure can, and it's common enough and pretty well-known by now I'd figure. So before you flip a lid, realize that while he wasn't totally right, he sort of was.

Michael Shannon killed it as kulkinski!!!

General Zod!!

nothing like the book/docu sorry it sucked

Could have made a movie rooting for his wife? Anyway, the movie is made and by all the reviews it will flop.

Yeah and that probably is the "movie side" of things. It's tough to have a story when there's nobody to root for.

Very true but if you watch this trailer they are very much trying to portray him for something he wasn't, like some kind of victim standing up for the family he loved and that is utter nonsense...THAT is what I was commenting on.


It's not about whether he deserved a movie made about him or not. The messed up truth is that ppl are interested in these monsters. People like Ed Gein, Jeffery Domer, Adolf Hitler. We think to ourselves, "How could somebody do such a thing?" and then we watch movies about them and read about them in hopes of better understanding their deranged minds. What exactly creates a monster how do these ppl see the world? Their perception is obviously very different from that of a normal person.

just watched the movie and it wasn't NEARLY as interesting as the real story.  Good acting, terrible story telling.

retard

i watched the documentary and red some articels , there was never something like that stated. 
can give a link or something ?

one of the best movies of 2013

get anitvirus software then you fucking idiot torrents dont give you viruses unless your a fucking retard as you no doubt are they have systems in place for people to vote down a torrent kind of like your dumb ass comment

not very accurate to the real story they should have done it more like how it happend it would have come out better

what a load of crap! Read the book by Anthony Bruno called The Iceman to get the real story behind Kuklinski. He was an evil psychopath who murder on a whim and terrorised his family. He once beat his pregnant wife so hard the unborn child was hanging out of her and consequently died.
A man like that does not deserve a movie made of him!!

Zod?

I've been torrenting my whole damn life and never got infected even once.

Not gonna flame you like most other people on the net will, but just letting you know that if you know a bit about computers you can 100% of the time protect yourself from viruses.
Thing is many people don't know how to use computers and click on stupid ads (e.g. you are 999th visitor you won 1 million USD) or complete stupid surveys, download FAKE torrents etc.
If you know your way around, you'll be fine.
Same in real life - careful who you trust or you'll get stabbed in the back.

I thought they did a great job of showing the unresolvable contradiction: how the fuck can this doting family man, be a mass murderer. He showed a different side to his family, that's for sure. Shannon is probably the best actor working right now, he is better than veterans. Just when you thought he was all about nerd freakouts, he nails this part which involves a blue collar, ancient like... fucking werewolf. Anyway, I'd like to see anyone in the world disrespect Shannon. He always kills it.

i was kinda disappointed by this movie. they tried to show the iceman from a more human side which in my opinion totally neglected his montrous side. if you watch the iceman interviews with the real guy it becomes clear that he is such a dark person and i know he must have seemed softer to his family and friends but in my opinion the movie didn't really put a lot of effort into showing that psychopatchic side.

in my opinion, yes, it is worth buying. it was really good!

This movie was great! I always loved crime dramas. It was a really good gangster flick.

Is this a good movie? Is it worth the buy?

like 100 movies over the past 3 years have been downloaded and no problems on macbook or pc.

"piracy is a crime"

gay

piracy is a crime


I knew the Mr Softee guy i made fun of his son and he threw a milkshake all over me, i was 13. He was a coward.

Yeah, I hate myself, I'm disgusted by myself. I detest myself and not to mention that I'm corrupted in my brain.. :(

I downloaded thousands of torrents, 0 viruses so far. 

"don't go full retard" 

The most mainstream comment youtube or any global website ever seen.

Yeah, I know, I'm complete retard.

Already did, sorry bro.

This looks interesting. Winona Ryder is in so I might check it out. Michael Shannon is untouchable, ok?

dont go full retard

goooooooooood movie


one of the best movies i have watched this year, if not the best..

Very poorly written and more importantly directed movie considering the vast amount of material these guys had to work from.

ZOOOOOOD! KRYPTON

that means its "impossible" to receive viruses over torrents if you have a brain superior to that of a goldfish. i wish you good luck in the ocean, watch out for the bigger fish

8 inches.....

They better make this good cause RIchard was a pathalogical liar and a constant wife beater. This movie makes him such a family man and not the cold blooded killer he is in real life. 

crazy good movie!

Deffo recommend- on par with films such as Goodfellas and the departed

I hope there is a scene in this movie where Michael Shannon freaks out and tells everyone off like in his other movies, he is so awesome at that

 I Will FIND HIM!

You and 49 other idiots.. Join Miley Cirus.

Its Greg boule guys!

Omg Why not leave the name of the movie for the SUper hero... Jesus!!!

Anyone else is here because they have seen ZOD in MAN OF STEEL? Well, I am:)

no me ha gustado el protagonista que interpreta a RICHARD KUKLINSKI tiene sentimientos hacia los que mata y el kuklinski real ha dicho siempre que el nunca sintio nada hacia las personas que asesinaba

Hentai, oh really?

Enjoy your viruses 

There is a interview with the real ice man on youtube, He is fucked up 

yify bought use here

The film was okay. The lead played Richard fine. However, the film seem to paint him in an anti-hero type of light, when he was a cold blooded murderer who enjoyed killing. One of the most cruel murders they left out, was when he killed an innocent man waiting for a bus with his new crossbow, just to see if it worked. And it didn't show how he would savagely beat his wife and daughters. If film also didn't show how he would set a lot of guys up with fake deals, then killed and robbed them. 

Yah, they did miss a lot.  Still not sure how they could have fit it all in.  Even if half of what Kuklinski said was true, this would have had to be a 4 hour film just to get half of that in.  

Still, the director seemed to water it down, but Shannon carried this film superbly.  If the story were stronger, this would have been an epic movie.

Shannon carried this film with true force.  He seems to have that air of intensity that the book generates around Kuklinski, and his eyes alone speak much of the best dialogue.  You dont see many actors who can do that.  The story could have been better done, but it would have been extraordinarily tough given it covers 20 years.

The actor made this film, and does it well enough for me to still be pretty damned good.  Many people expected a ficton mob thriller.  This was a true story adaptation.

Based on a true story, not a documentary.  You dumb illiterate fucks.

is this a talk talk movie or action?

Noobs, I use xbmc with icefilms :D

Michael Shannon is amazing. He has this unique magnetism like R. de Niro. You just want to watch him as he acts. I hope Micheal will involve himself in even more requiring roles. His potential is outstanding!

Wonderful movie! <3

They never showed kuklinskis sick sense of humour in the film, not even once :( its still pretty good tho

GO HOME ZOD YOU ARE DRUNK

the movie was a disipointment miss out loads of key points and murders. 
1.the murder of the shot gun what blows his the mans face off at the red lights.
2.the one where the men tryed to run him off the road and he got out his car and killed all 4 of the men.
3.where they had the bet when he shot the man in the adams apple. 

sorry for bad grammar :) 

You.. are completely correct!
I too wanted to see this film, but what the fuck?
Seriously garbage film made with money in sight only. The re-made the true story to fit how a film should be. Not how reality was.

If you really need to see this film then I encourage everyone to just download this film and spread it illegal so moviecreator do not get money.
Watch "Confessions of a mafia hitman" instead. Its THE only way to see Kuklinski. 

Thumbs up for Silverhourse comment

Your statement is so wrong. Its not a great film, its shit. Utter fking shit. Moviecreator is bending the truth in this film. But no matter what, you are truly wrong. He beat his wife several times. According to himself, he felt most happiness when beeing home with his family, but it didnt stop him from beeing him. A monster who did not care when it came to cruelty.

His family broke all contact. Says it all. So read up better on the story cause ur wrong. "Confessions of a mafia hitman" (1992).

Youtube searchfield; "Confessions of a mafia hitman"
Better to have it without it taking up any space.

Do not watch this film legit, download it! Dont give maker any money for bending the truth when he could have made the true story.

Why is he suddenly a loving father and husband in this film? In "Confessions of a mafia hitman" you see his wife and its pretty hard to miss how her nose has been broken several times. 

The mafia may have gotten interest in Kuklinski, but they had absolutly nothing to do with his first murder or how he turned bad.  Watch 'Confessions of a mafia hitman' instead!

Scenetime reporting in

haha me too xD 

Any luck ? 

He may have had three kids? but how are you gunner know that he dint flip out on his wife? he isn't gunner tell every single detail off his life is he.

kickass is kickass

I have watched every documentary and read every book about Richard Kuklinski. I have to say I was real excited about this movie when it came out. But....They completely dropped the ball on this one. There were a few parts that were true to the books and documentaries. But the rest was just not there it lacked the kuklinski flare. I think they should get another big name movie company and redo this one from the ground up. Use the books use the documentaries and redo the film.

Zod kills captain america in this! lol great movie

never mind the movie is already out on youtube lol

Saw the whole documentary, cant wait to see how they pull this off!!

So you are THAT guy.


Not really

somone say what is that song called in movie,when they killed that guy in club with spray.


General Zod + Captain America = The Iceman

Nowhere close to being as good as the book!

Still made a pretty fucking good movie.

the movie missed out his whole childhood from the book.

Mine is Viooz <3

This was surprisingly a really good movie! some things embellished but over all, a great job!

THIS IS A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT!!! YOU COULD WATCH THIS MOVIE FREE WITHOUT DOWNLOAD ON VIOOZ.COM

I WILL FIND HIM !!!

great film, but he had three kids, not even two and he never flipped out on his wife and busted up their kitchen

His voice is the same? He,s a stone cold killer!

good movie! wished they showed more though, like when he was young instead of jumping right onto the middle of the plot. But still a good movie.

swj ch?op !!

mine also hahaha


anyone know where to get we're the millers or wat


Michael Shannon is an outstanding actor 

I tohught It was gonna be an ICEMAN, like Yeti or sometihng.....I have such childish exceptations

Good job, im sure he raised you better! Were you raised or thrown up?

hahaha true


after seen the documentary first i have to say it was more intense than the slightly rushed and cramped film. 

Hahah you know me too well!

Actually kickass torrents its waay better!

just saw movie, fucking badass

Clown

you stupid idiot you know absolutely nothing try watching a fucking interview with his wife. eat shit, richard kuklinsky is a hero

kneel before zod!

Saw this just right now, I must say it's a very good movie. Would of enjoyed it more if it was longer and showed more out of his life from when he was a little kid. But good movie :D

He nearly killed his wife by stabbing her in the back.  He also caused her to have miscarriages and his children lived in constant fear of him.  Yeah, he was a stone cold psychopath.  He sometimes murdered on impulse and not for money.  He insisted in interviews, though, that he never killed women and children and thought of himself as a good family man.The movie may not be glorifying him, but depicting his self-delusions.

U sure got a shitty grammar 

hahaha rofl, clearly you dont understand acting hahahah 

   rarbg.com/torrent/gmf6v32

Wow it wasn't like this AT ALL. Not even gonna pirate it.

*sole purpose

"Look at this. We could have rebuilt Krypton on this planet, but you chose the humans over us. I exist only to protect Krypton. That is the soul purpose for which I was born. And every action I take, no matter how violent or how cruel, is for the greater good of my people. And now, I have no people. My soul, that is what you have taken from me!"

stfu dad

do i get a free virus to ?

A bit of an unnecessary Foul mouthed reaction don't you think? And by the way, using language like that just shows that you're of inferior Intelligence. 


stfu faggot.......we wont have tbp because of kooks like you......noob cunt

Watch this /watch?v=QBS4iKvBj6c the interview of the real iceman an evil bastard who clearly didn't care and felt nothing when he killed. But they do clear up why hes like it 9/10 its always the genes and the way you are brought up 

even sounds like him, a scary man!

You Know what...some of yous wouldn't know talent if it slapped you in you f..in face. Just seen the movie. Didn't like Michael Shannon till I watched this. He adapted perfectly for this role. And let's face it...he could easily play a psyco's role. He has that kinda face. This movie just lacked the right marketing and the screenplay could've been rearranged a lil better. Just seemed like they could've expanded more on his killing sprees..I mean... the guy was active from '48 - '86. 

Just saw this movie, holy fucking shit Michael Shannon is an AMAZING actor.

keep trolling bro :) 

U sure got a shitty taste

How could they fuck up such a film? SHITTY casting ,mediocre script, winona sucks ass , Michael Shannon is mediocre and not up to the task, Mr Softee is a strong character yet downplayed in the script and the actor is mediocre. A shitty job all around- was really sadened cause that psychopath's story could have been an oscar movie if it was done right. The documentary outperfoms the movie

piratebay sons

go for it


fuck no micheal shannon is one of the worst actors that ever lived lmao 

Great movie, one of my favorites.

seems awesome, i must watch xD

damn near oscar like performance as a damn comic book villain, that says it all.

real ice cold badass.

yify,

no


He did. He was a sociopath and killed when he needed to. We do glorify these guys because ultimately Kuklinski was a serial killer who happened to find the right work at the right time. He practiced and perfect the art of the kill and was a real hitman. A byproduct of Gangland and all its excesses.  

It's that crazy German doctor!

Take a hike!

this movie was crap I expected to see more killings. Read the book its way better

"I dont kill women or children" and that's how America glorifies killers, puts them in the limelight, and expect us to go "WOW HE'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD GUY! KILLING THOSE BAD DUDES AND STUFF" by somehow making one human life more important than the next through the brainwashing of children and women being more important than men. Oh I forgot, because we're in front lines in war our lives are more expendable. Gotta love it. Chances are he probably did kill his share of women.

8 inches.....

kickass is kickass

I have watched every documentary and read every book about Richard Kuklinski. I have to say I was real excited about this movie when it came out. But....They completely dropped the ball on this one. There were a few parts that were true to the books and documentaries. But the rest was just not there it lacked the kuklinski flare. I think they should get another big name movie company and redo this one from the ground up. Use the books use the documentaries and redo the film.

Zod kills captain america in this! lol great movie

never mind the movie is already out on youtube lol

Saw the whole documentary, cant wait to see how they pull this off!!

So you are THAT guy.


Not really

somone say what is that song called in movie,when they killed that guy in club with spray.


General Zod + Captain America = The Iceman

Nowhere close to being as good as the book!

Still made a pretty fucking good movie.

the movie missed out his whole childhood from the book.

Mine is Viooz <3

This was surprisingly a really good movie! some things embellished but over all, a great job!

THIS IS A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT!!! YOU COULD WATCH THIS MOVIE FREE WITHOUT DOWNLOAD ON VIOOZ.COM

I WILL FIND HIM !!!

great film, but he had three kids, not even two and he never flipped out on his wife and busted up their kitchen

His voice is the same? He,s a stone cold killer!

good movie! wished they showed more though, like when he was young instead of jumping right onto the middle of the plot. But still a good movie.

swj ch?op !!

mine also hahaha


anyone know where to get we're the millers or wat


Michael Shannon is an outstanding actor 

I tohught It was gonna be an ICEMAN, like Yeti or sometihng.....I have such childish exceptations

Good job, im sure he raised you better! Were you raised or thrown up?

hahaha true


after seen the documentary first i have to say it was more intense than the slightly rushed and cramped film. 

Hahah you know me too well!

Actually kickass torrents its waay better!

just saw movie, fucking badass

Clown

you stupid idiot you know absolutely nothing try watching a fucking interview with his wife. eat shit, richard kuklinsky is a hero

kneel before zod!

Saw this just right now, I must say it's a very good movie. Would of enjoyed it more if it was longer and showed more out of his life from when he was a little kid. But good movie :D

He nearly killed his wife by stabbing her in the back.  He also caused her to have miscarriages and his children lived in constant fear of him.  Yeah, he was a stone cold psychopath.  He sometimes murdered on impulse and not for money.  He insisted in interviews, though, that he never killed women and children and thought of himself as a good family man.The movie may not be glorifying him, but depicting his self-delusions.

U sure got a shitty grammar 

hahaha rofl, clearly you dont understand acting hahahah

Wow it wasn't like this AT ALL. Not even gonna pirate it.

*sole purpose

"Look at this. We could have rebuilt Krypton on this planet, but you chose the humans over us. I exist only to protect Krypton. That is the soul purpose for which I was born. And every action I take, no matter how violent or how cruel, is for the greater good of my people. And now, I have no people. My soul, that is what you have taken from me!"

stfu dad

do i get a free virus to ?

A bit of an unnecessary Foul mouthed reaction don't you think? And by the way, using language like that just shows that you're of inferior Intelligence. 


stfu faggot.......we wont have tbp because of kooks like you......noob cunt

Watch this /watch?v=QBS4iKvBj6c the interview of the real iceman an evil bastard who clearly didn't care and felt nothing when he killed. But they do clear up why hes like it 9/10 its always the genes and the way you are brought up 

even sounds like him, a scary man!

You Know what...some of yous wouldn't know talent if it slapped you in you f..in face. Just seen the movie. Didn't like Michael Shannon till I watched this. He adapted perfectly for this role. And let's face it...he could easily play a psyco's role. He has that kinda face. This movie just lacked the right marketing and the screenplay could've been rearranged a lil better. Just seemed like they could've expanded more on his killing sprees..I mean... the guy was active from '48 - '86. 

Just saw this movie, holy fucking shit Michael Shannon is an AMAZING actor.

keep trolling bro :) 

U sure got a shitty taste

How could they fuck up such a film? SHITTY casting ,mediocre script, winona sucks ass , Michael Shannon is mediocre and not up to the task, Mr Softee is a strong character yet downplayed in the script and the actor is mediocre. A shitty job all around- was really sadened cause that psychopath's story could have been an oscar movie if it was done right. The documentary outperfoms the movie

piratebay sons

go for it


fuck no micheal shannon is one of the worst actors that ever lived lmao 

Great movie, one of my favorites.

seems awesome, i must watch xD

damn near oscar like performance as a damn comic book villain, that says it all.

real ice cold badass.

yify,

no


He did. He was a sociopath and killed when he needed to. We do glorify these guys because ultimately Kuklinski was a serial killer who happened to find the right work at the right time. He practiced and perfect the art of the kill and was a real hitman. A byproduct of Gangland and all its excesses.  

It's that crazy German doctor!

Take a hike!

this movie was crap I expected to see more killings. Read the book its way better

"I dont kill women or children" and that's how America glorifies killers, puts them in the limelight, and expect us to go "WOW HE'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD GUY! KILLING THOSE BAD DUDES AND STUFF" by somehow making one human life more important than the next through the brainwashing of children and women being more important than men. Oh I forgot, because we're in front lines in war our lives are more expendable. Gotta love it. Chances are he probably did kill his share of women.

8 inches.....

They better make this good cause RIchard was a pathalogical liar and a constant wife beater. This movie makes him such a family man and not the cold blooded killer he is in real life. 

crazy good movie!

Deffo recommend- on par with films such as Goodfellas and the departed

I hope there is a scene in this movie where Michael Shannon freaks out and tells everyone off like in his other movies, he is so awesome at that

 I Will FIND HIM!

You and 49 other idiots.. Join Miley Cirus.

Its Greg boule guys!

Omg Why not leave the name of the movie for the SUper hero... Jesus!!!

Anyone else is here because they have seen ZOD in MAN OF STEEL? Well, I am:)

no me ha gustado el protagonista que interpreta a RICHARD KUKLINSKI tiene sentimientos hacia los que mata y el kuklinski real ha dicho siempre que el nunca sintio nada hacia las personas que asesinaba

Hentai, oh really?

Enjoy your viruses 

There is a interview with the real ice man on youtube, He is fucked up 

yify bought use here

The film was okay. The lead played Richard fine. However, the film seem to paint him in an anti-hero type of light, when he was a cold blooded murderer who enjoyed killing. One of the most cruel murders they left out, was when he killed an innocent man waiting for a bus with his new crossbow, just to see if it worked. And it didn't show how he would savagely beat his wife and daughters. If film also didn't show how he would set a lot of guys up with fake deals, then killed and robbed them. 

Yah, they did miss a lot.  Still not sure how they could have fit it all in.  Even if half of what Kuklinski said was true, this would have had to be a 4 hour film just to get half of that in.  

Still, the director seemed to water it down, but Shannon carried this film superbly.  If the story were stronger, this would have been an epic movie.

Shannon carried this film with true force.  He seems to have that air of intensity that the book generates around Kuklinski, and his eyes alone speak much of the best dialogue.  You dont see many actors who can do that.  The story could have been better done, but it would have been extraordinarily tough given it covers 20 years.

The actor made this film, and does it well enough for me to still be pretty damned good.  Many people expected a ficton mob thriller.  This was a true story adaptation.

Based on a true story, not a documentary.  You dumb illiterate fucks.

is this a talk talk movie or action?

Noobs, I use xbmc with icefilms :D

Michael Shannon is amazing. He has this unique magnetism like R. de Niro. You just want to watch him as he acts. I hope Micheal will involve himself in even more requiring roles. His potential is outstanding!

Wonderful movie! <3

They never showed kuklinskis sick sense of humour in the film, not even once :( its still pretty good tho

GO HOME ZOD YOU ARE DRUNK

the movie was a disipointment miss out loads of key points and murders. 
1.the murder of the shot gun what blows his the mans face off at the red lights.
2.the one where the men tryed to run him off the road and he got out his car and killed all 4 of the men.
3.where they had the bet when he shot the man in the adams apple. 

sorry for bad grammar :) 

You.. are completely correct!
I too wanted to see this film, but what the fuck?
Seriously garbage film made with money in sight only. The re-made the true story to fit how a film should be. Not how reality was.

If you really need to see this film then I encourage everyone to just download this film and spread it illegal so moviecreator do not get money.
Watch "Confessions of a mafia hitman" instead. Its THE only way to see Kuklinski. 

Thumbs up for Silverhourse comment

Your statement is so wrong. Its not a great film, its shit. Utter fking shit. Moviecreator is bending the truth in this film. But no matter what, you are truly wrong. He beat his wife several times. According to himself, he felt most happiness when beeing home with his family, but it didnt stop him from beeing him. A monster who did not care when it came to cruelty.

His family broke all contact. Says it all. So read up better on the story cause ur wrong. "Confessions of a mafia hitman" (1992).

Youtube searchfield; "Confessions of a mafia hitman"
Better to have it without it taking up any space.

Do not watch this film legit, download it! Dont give maker any money for bending the truth when he could have made the true story.

Why is he suddenly a loving father and husband in this film? In "Confessions of a mafia hitman" you see his wife and its pretty hard to miss how her nose has been broken several times. 

The mafia may have gotten interest in Kuklinski, but they had absolutly nothing to do with his first murder or how he turned bad.  Watch 'Confessions of a mafia hitman' instead!
